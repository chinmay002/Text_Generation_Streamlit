The One Where It All Began

There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

You're going out with a guy.

There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

All right, Joey, be nice.

So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

Wait. Does he eat chalk?

I don't want her to go
through what I did with Carl.

Okay, everybody relax.

Relax. This is not even a date.

It's just two people going out to
dinner and not having sex.

Sounds like a date to me.

I'm in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria. . .

. . .and I realize I'm totally naked.

I've had that dream.

Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone. . .

. . .there.

-Instead of--
-That's right!

That one, I've never had.

All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

I don't know what to do.
Everybody's looking at me.

They weren't looking at you before?

Finally, I figure
I'd better answer it.

And it turns out it's my mother.

Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

This guy says, ''Hello,''
I wanna kill myself.

You okay, sweetie?

I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth. . .

-. . .and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

Carol moved out today.

-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

Just leave my aura alone, okay?

Fine. Be murky.

I'll be fine.
I hope she'll be very happy.

No, you don't.

To hell with her. She left me!

And you never knew she was a lesbian.

Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

She didn't know.
How should I know?

Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

Did I say that out loud?

I told Mom and Dad last night.
They seemed to take it well.

Really? So that hysterical call I got
from a woman sobbing at 3 a.m. . .

. . . ''I'll never have grandchildren! ''

Was, what? A wrong number?

Sorry.

Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

You're angry. You're hurting.

Can I tell you what
the answer is?

Strip joints!

Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

I just want to be married again.

And I just want a million dollars!

Rachel?

Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said. . .

. . .that you might be here and you are.

-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe. . .

. . .and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

Sure!

You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

I was in this room with
all the presents. . .

. . .and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

When all of a sudden I realize--
Sweet 'N Low?

I realized. . .

. . .I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

''Tuna or egg salad?''

''Decide! ''

''I'll have whatever
Christine is having. ''

Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

I'm sorry.

I just don't love him.

Well, it matters to me!

''If I let go of my hair,
my head will fall off. ''

She should not be
wearing those pants.

I say push her down the stairs!

Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

Come on, Daddy, listen!

All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

What if I want to be a purse?

Or a hat?''

I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

It's a metaphor, Daddy!

You can see where he'd have trouble.

Look, Daddy, it's my life.

Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

Well, maybe that's my decision.

Well, maybe I don't need your money.

Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

La la la something
And noodles with string

-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

I helped.

This is probably for
the best, you know?

Independence.
Taking control of your life.

The whole ''hat'' thing.

If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

What? Like there's
a rule or something?

I got it.

Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

It's Paul.

Oh, God. Is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

Maybe.

Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

He finally asked you out?

It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

Rach, I can cancel.

Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

That'd be good.

-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

Does he sell it, drink it,
or he just complains a lot?

Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

I'll be right back.
I've just got to go a--

A-wandering?

Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

Hey, Paul. Here's a little tip.

She likes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot. . .

. . .over and over again, till
it starts to get a little red.

Shut up, Joey!

Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

. . .so, nothing.

Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

. . .big lizards.

If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

And we're very excited about it.

Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

Pheebs, wanna help?

I wish I could, but I don't want to.

Love is sweet as summer showers

Love is a wondrous work of art

But your love, oh, your love
Your love

Is like a giant pigeon

Crapping on my heart

Thank you!

I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

We got a bookcase here.

It's a beautiful thing.

What's this?

I would have to say that is
an L-shaped bracket.

-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

This was Carol's favorite beer.

She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

If you start with that,
we're out of here.

Please don't spoil all this fun.

Let me ask you a question.

She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

What did you get?

You guys.

-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

I mean, how clean can teeth get?

My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

How did you get through it?

He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

-Say her--
-Leg?

That's one way of going through it.

Me, I went for the watch.

You actually broke her watch?
The worst thing I ever did was. . .

. . .I shredded my old boyfriend's
favorite bath towel.

-Steer clear of you!
-That's right.

Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

It's about me.
And I just--

Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

I know that some girl is going to be
lucky to become Mr. Barry Finkel.

But it isn't me.
It's not me.

Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is
right now, but give me a chance to--

I'm divorced!

I'm only 26 and I'm divorced.

Shut up.

That only took me an hour.

Between us, we haven't had a
relationship last longer than a Mento.

You, however, have had the love
of a woman for four years.

Four years of closeness and sharing.

After which,
she ripped your heart out. . .

. . .and that is why we don't do it.

I don't think that was my point.

You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

What are you talking about?
One woman.

That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

Then stay out of my freezer.

Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

What? What?

You wanna spell it out with noodles?

It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

So there's going to be a fifth date?

Isn't there?

Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

What were you going to say?

Ever since she left me. . .

. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

. . .sexually.

Oh, God! Oh, God!

I'm so sorry.

Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

How long?

Two years.

I'm glad you smashed her watch.

So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

Yeah, I do.

We are gathered here
to join together...

...Joanie Louise Cunningham...

...and Charles Chachi,
Chachi, Chachi...

...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

-Marriage is the most sacred--
-See!

But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

''Grab a spoon. ''

Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

Great story. But I gotta go.

I got a date with Andrea.

Angela. Andrea. Oh, man.

Andrea's the screamer.
Angela has cats.

Right, thanks. It's Julie.
I'm out of here.

You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

. . .to ask a woman out. . .

. . .who am I going to ask?

Isn't this amazing?

I have never made coffee
before in my life.

-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

I figure if I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland,
there isn't anything I can't do. ''

If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

-Good morning.
-Good morning.

-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

Thank you.

-Thank you so much.
-Stop!

Last night was like. . .

. . .all my birthdays, graduations, plus
the barn-raising scene in Witness.

We'll talk later.

Thank you.

That wasn't a real date.

What the hell do you do
on a real date?

Shut up and put my table back.

I've got to get to work.

If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

So, like, you guys all have jobs?

Yeah, we all have jobs.

That's how we buy stuff.

Yeah, I'm an actor.

Have I seen you in anything?

I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

. . .at the Little Theater in the Park.

It was a job, all right?

''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

I will not take this abuse.

You're right. I'm sorry.

Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

You should both know that
he's a dead man.

Oh, Chandler!

How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

I know. He's just so--

Remember you and Tony De Marco?

Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

-Are you in trouble!
-Big time!

Want a wedding dress?
Hardly used.

We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here.

I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

-Wish me luck!
-What for?

I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

How was Florida?

You had sex, didn't you?

How do you do that?

I hate you. I'm pushing my
aunt through Parrot Jungle. . .

. . .and you're having sex.

So, who?

You know Paul?

Paul, the wine guy?

Yeah, I know Paul.

You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

Of course it was a line.

Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

I hate men. I hate men!

Don't hate. Don't put that out
in the universe.

Is it me?

Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

Come here.
Give me your feet.

I just thought he was
nice, you know?

I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

Guess what?

-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

I'm trained for nothing.

I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

You're surprisingly upbeat.

You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

. . .50% percent off.

How well you know me.

They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

I've got great boots,'' boots.

-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

And who pays for that?

My father.

Come on, is this necessary?

I can stop charging any time I want.

You can't live off your parents.

I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

And then he killed himself.

Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

The word you're looking for is:

''Anyway. . . . ''

You ready?

No, I'm not ready.
How can I be ready?

''You ready to jump out of
the plane without a chute?''

I can't do this.

-I know you can.
-I don't think so.

You made coffee.
You can do anything.

Cut, cut, cut.

You know what?

We can just leave it at that.
Like a symbolic gesture.

That was a library card.

If you listen very closely, you can
hear a thousand retailers scream.

Welcome to the real world!

It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

That's it.

You gonna crash on the couch?

-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

Look what I just
found on the floor.

What?

That's Paul's watch.

You can just put it back
where you found it.

Oh, boy! All right.

-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

-I'm sorry.
-No!

-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

. . .a major crush on you.

I knew.

You did?

I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

I did.

Listen, do you think--

And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

Maybe.

Okay, maybe I will.

-Good night.
-Good night.

See you.

Wait, wait.

What's with you?

I just grabbed a spoon.

I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

I can 't believe
What I'm hearing

-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

Would you stop?

Was I doing it again?

I said that you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

You wouldn't know a great
butt if it bit you.

There's an image.

Would anybody like more coffee?

Did you make it?

-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

Kids, new dream.

I'm in Las Vegas.

Miss, more coffee?

Excuse me? Could you give this
to that guy over there?

Go ahead.

Thank you.

Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

So I'm in Las Vegas.

I'm Liza Minnelli.

You guys don't understand.

For us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

Yeah, right!

You serious?

Oh, yeah!

All you need to know
is in the first kiss.

Absolutely.

For us, kissing's an opening act. . .

. . .like the comedian
you have to sit through. . .

. . .before Pink Floyd comes out.

And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

It's just that that's not. . .

. . .why we bought the ticket.

The problem is, after the concert,
no matter how great the show was. . .

. . .you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

We're in the car, fighting traffic. . .

. . .just trying to stay awake.

Well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

Are we still talking about sex?

The One With the Sonogram at the End

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

No, it's good.
It is good.

It's just that doesn't she seem
a little angry?

Well, she has issues.

Does she?

He's out banging other women
with a club. . .

. . .while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

Marsha, see, these are cave people.

Okay, they have issues like:

''Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close! '' See?

Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

Okay. Yes, it is.

I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age.

Hi.

So. . . .

You look great.

I hate that.

Sorry.

Thanks. You look good too.

Well, you know,
in here, anyone who. . .

. . .stands erect. . . .

So what's new?
Still a--

A lesbian?

You never know.

How's the family?

Marty's still totally paranoid.

Carol, why are you here?

I'm pregnant.

Pregnant!

She didn 't leave
in such a hurry after all.

This is the Three's Company episode
where's there's a misunderstanding.

Then I've already seen this one.

Are you through with that?

Sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

Whose ball of paper is this?

That's mine. I wrote a note to
myself, then I didn't need it.

So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed-- It's fine.

I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

We know how cruel parents can be. . .

. . .about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

Monica? Hi!

Monica, you're scaring me.

I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

Not in a good way.

Yeah, calm down.

You don't see Ross getting chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

You see, he's ''The Prince. ''

Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful!

Oh, God! Oh, God!

No, don't touch that.

Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to return it to him.

''Barry, remember me?
I'm the girl. . .

. . .that stomped on your heart
in front of your family''

Now I must return the ring,
without the ring. . .

. . .which makes it so much harder.

Easy, we'll find it.
Won't we?

Okay, look.

When did you have it last?

Doy! Probably
right before she lost it.

You don't get
a lot of ''doy'' these days.

I know I had it this morning.

I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with. . . .

Dinah?

Oh, don't be mad.

-You didn't!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

I gave you one job!

But look how straight
those noodles are.

That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

I just can't do it.

Boys?

We're going in!

Hi.

That is not a happy ''hi. ''

Carol's pregnant.

I found it!

Yeah.

Do that for two hours. . .

. . .you might be where I am
right about now.

That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

How do you fit
into this whole thing?

Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

Basically, it's totally up to me.

She is so great.
I miss her.

What does she mean by ''involved''?

Presumably, the biggest
part of your job is done.

Anyway, they want me
to go down to this. . .

. . .sonogram thing
with them tomorrow.

What'll you do?

I have no idea.

No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

This is still ruined, right?

Martha Lugwin's daughter
is going to call you.

What's that curry taste?

Curry.

I think they're great.
I really do.

Remember the Lugwins?
The big one had a thing for you.

They all had a thing for him!

Oh, Mom!

Why is this girl going to call me?

She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking, food. . .

. . .or I don't know.

I told her you had a restaurant.

I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

They don't have to know that.

Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's. . .

. . .easy.

This'll sound unbelievably selfish
on my part. . .

. . .but did you plan on bringing
up the baby/lesbian thing?

It'd take the heat off of me.

What Rachel did to her life!
We ran into her parents at the club.

They were not playing very well.

I won't say what they
spent on that wedding. . .

. . .but $40,000 is a lot of money.

At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing.

-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

Don't listen to her!
You've always been independent.

Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby. . .

. . .and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles. . . .

There are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

With his museum and
his papers getting published.

Others are satisfied as they are.

I'm telling you, these are
the people who never get cancer.

I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God. . .

. . .our little Harmonica
doesn't have that problem.

So, Ross, what's going on with you?

Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering. . .

. . .what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

So here's the deal.

Carol's a lesbian.

She's living with a woman named Susan.

She's pregnant with my child.

And she and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

And you knew about this?

Your folks are really that bad?

Well, you know, these people are pros.

They know what they do.
They take their time.

They get the job done!

Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

Must pee!

It's worse when you're twins.

-You're a twin?
-Yeah. We don't speak.

She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

Chandler, you're an only child.
You don't have any of this.

No, although I did have
an imaginary friend. . .

. . .who my parents preferred.

Hit the lights, please.

How long was I in there?

I'm just cleaning up.

Do you need any help?

Okay, sure. Thanks.

Anyway. . . .

So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

A little.

A lot.

So, got any advice?

You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word ''dumped. ''

Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

You should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

You know, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-G YN.

You've got Carol tomorrow.

When did it get so complicated?

Got me.

Remember when we were
in high school together?

Didn't you think you'd meet someone. . .

. . .fall in love, and that'd be it?

Man! I never thought I'd be here.

Me neither.

Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway. . . .

Hi.

-You remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

So we're just waiting for. . .?

-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

-She.
-Of course, ''she. ''

Is she familiar with our
special situation?

Yes, and she's very supportive.

Great! Okay, that's great!

No, I'm. . . .

Thanks.

That opens my cervix.

Barry?

Come on in.

Are you sure?

It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

So how are you doing?

I'm. . . .

I'm okay.

You look great.

Dr. Farber, Jason
Greenspan 's gagging.

Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

I dumped him.

So how's this going to work. . .

. . .you know, with us?

You know, when important
decisions have to be made?

Give me a ''for instance. ''

Well, I don't know.

-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon. . .

. . .if it's a boy.
Minnie, if it's a girl.

As in ''Mouse''?

As in my grandmother.

Still, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse. ''

How about. . . .

How about ''Julia''?

Julia.

We agreed on Minnie.

We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

Things change.
Roll with the punches.

I believe Julia's on the table.

Sorry about that.

So what have you been up to?

Not much.

I got a job.

That's great!

Why are you so tan?

I went to Aruba.

Oh, no!
You went on our honeymoon alone?

No.

See, I went with. . . .

-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

I went with Mindy.

Mindy?

My maid of honor?

We're kind of a thing now.

You got plugs!

Careful, careful. They
haven't quite taken yet.

And you got lenses.

But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

Not for her.

Listen, I really
wanted to thank you.

A month ago,
I wanted to hurt you. . .

. . .more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone.

And I'm an orthodontist.

You know, you were right.

I thought we were happy.

We weren't.

But with Mindy. . .

. . .now I'm happy.

-Spit.
-What?

Me.

Anyway. . . .

I guess this belongs to you.

And thank you for giving it to me.

Well, thank you for giving it back.

Hello!

Oh, please!
What's wrong with Helen?

Helen Geller?

l don't think so!

It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Thank you.

No. I mean, it's not Geller.

It'll be Helen Willick?

Actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

It's my baby too.

Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

And we all know what
a challenge that is.

You two, stop it!

She gets a credit!
I'm in there too!

Not Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
I think that borders on child abuse.

Of course not!
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

He knows no one will
say all those names.

They'll end up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

My way?
You think this is my way?

Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being. . .

. . .this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

Knock, knock!
How are we today? Any nausea?

-A little.
-Just a little.

I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

Lie back.

You know what? I'm gonna go.

I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

Oh, my God!

Look at that!

I know!

Well, isn't that amazing?

What are we supposed to see?

I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes. . .

. . .it kind of looks
like an old potato.

Then don't do that, all right?

What do you think?

Are you welling up?

You are.

-You are. You're welling up.
-I'm not.

-You're going to be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up!

Hi, Mindy!

Hi, it's Rachel.

Yeah, I'm fine.
I saw Barry today.

He told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

And, Min, you know,
if everything works out. . .

. . .and you guys end up getting
married and having kids. . .

. . .I hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose!

I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!

- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.

- How did it go?
- Not so good.

He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."

He said, "Let's do this again."
That's good, right?

Translated, "Let's do this again"
means, "You'll never see me naked."

Since when?

Since always.
It's, like, dating language.

Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."

"You're nice" means, "I'll be
dating alcoholics..

and complaining
about them to you."

"We should see
other people" means:

"Ha-ha, I already am!"

Everybody knows this?

Cushions the blow.

Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep..

and saying it went to a farm.

That's funny. Because our
parents actually did..

send our dog off to live on a farm.

Ross?

Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

And it was..

Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

The One With the Thumb

How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?

Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

That was really good!

Thanks. Let's keep going.

So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

Smoke away!

I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

- What?
- Relax your hand.

Let your wrist go.

Not so much!

All right. Now take a puff.

Right.

- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.

It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

When you hold it,
you feel right.

You feel complete.

- You miss it?
- No, not so much.

All right. Now we smoke.

Oh, my God!

- Give me that!
- No. You've got options.

You can smoke like this:

- Chandler
- Or hold it in your mouth.

Give me the cigarette!

- You try.
- Thank you.

Okay, how's this?

Okay, that's not bad.

All right, when you're finished,
it's cool if you flick it.

All right, you keep practicing..

and I'll go put out the sofa.

I thought it was foot size.

No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb..

to the tip of his index finger.

That's ridiculous.

Can I use either thumb?

I'd rather go with the foot theory.

All right. Don't tell me.

Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

Coffee, black.

Latte.

And an iced tea.

- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!

Good for me!

- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth

It's my bank.

- What did they do?
- It's nothing

I get my mail and
open their monthly "statement."

Easy!

And there's $500 extra in my account.

Satan's minions at work again!

Now I have to go deal with them

- What are you talking about? Keep it!
- It's not mine.

If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

Know what I'd hear with every step?
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

"Not-not mine. Not-not mine."

We're with you. We got it.

I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

Chandler, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

Oh, gross!

- What is this?
- I'm smoking!

You've been so good for three years!

And this is my reward.

Think about what you went
through when you quit.

Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

So this time I won't quit.

- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!

Oh, no!

I can't drink this now.

I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

With Alan again?
How's it going?

It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

When do we get to meet him?

Let's see, it's Monday..

- Never.
- Come on!

Not after what happened with Steve.

What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

Sorry.

I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.

Then can we meet him?

No.

Sorry.

Joey. Let it go.

Why should they meet him?

I bring a guy home and they're like..

coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef..

I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.

Your friends are just
looking after you.

I wish that once I'd date a guy
they liked.

You realize the odds of that
happening are slimmer..

- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.

- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.

Okay, I'm done.

Let it go, Ross.

You didn't know Chi-Chi.

- Do you all promise?
- We promise.

We'll be good.

Chandler, do you promise to be good?

You can come in, but your
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.

We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..

and hope you'll accept
this football phone..

as our gift."
Do you believe it?

Now I have $ 1000
and a football phone.

What bank is this?

Okay, it's him.

- Who is it?
- Alan.

Chandler! He's here!

Do I look okay?

One more button.

Closed! How about closed?

- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

Please be good.

Remember how much you all like me?

Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

I've heard so much about
all you guys.

I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

Who's gonna take the first shot?

Come on!

I'll go.

Let's start with how he
kept picking

I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.

We loved him!

Wait! We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

That pimento trick!

I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.

And did you notice?

Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.

- Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
- What shoe?

From the rhyme.

There was a man
With a crooked smile

Who lived in a shoe
For a while

So I think Alan..

is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.

Future boyfriends?

- I think this could be "it."
- Really?

I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

You know I'll be doing that
at parties.

- Know what I like most?
- What?

The way he makes me feel about myself.

How was the game?

Well..

We won!

Fantastic! Question.
How is that possible?

- Alan.
- He was unbelievable!

Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..

It was like he made us into a team.

We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

Can I ask a question?

Do you think Alan is sometimes..

What?

I don't know. A little too "Alan"?

Oh, no. Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan."

It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.

I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, weird girl.

- I brought alphabet soup.
- Pick out the vowels?

I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."

- And something else.
- Saltines?

No, $1000 and a football phone.

What?

Oh, my God!

- There's really money in here.
- I know.

What are you doing?

I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't

- Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.

- It's okay. Thanks.
- Let me do something.

I'll tell you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

- Okay.
- Okay.

Keep the change.

Thanks, Lizzy.

Want a pretzel?

- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

A thumb?

I know. There it was,
just floating..

like this tiny little hitchhiker.

Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five."

- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!

Don't do that. Come on!

It's worse than the thumb.

- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?

So I have a flaw! Big deal!

Joey's knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

I could live without it.

Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
when Phoebe chews her hair?

Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.

Oh, you do, do you?

There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

Indeed there isn't.

I should get back to work.

Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

Ever go out with a guy
your friends really like?

No.

I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.

Are we talking about the coyotes here?

All right! A cow got through.

Can you believe it?

It's just, you know what?

I just don't feel the "thing."

They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

Honey, you should always
feel the thing.

If that's how you feel about the guy,
dump him.

- It's gonna be really hard.
- He'll get over it.

No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?

I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

Alan wants to speak to you.

Really? He does?

Hey, buddy! What's up?

She told you about that, huh?

Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

It's not that

Well, that's true.

Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.

Well, okay. Thanks.

God, he's good.

- If only he were a woman.
- Yeah.

Lamb Chop!

How old is that sock?

If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..

so I killed him.

Do you think that was wrong?

- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

There you go.

I'm alive with pleasure now.

Phoebe, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

Hey, I might.

I'm sorry.

The soda people gave me $7000
for the thumb.

And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

What is up with the universe?

- What's going on?
- It's just nice when we're together.

It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

Please, guys, we have to talk.

Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.

No, I'm not.

- We have to talk.
- There it is!

Okay, it's about Alan.

Speaking of which, tell him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

Before you get into that,
there's something you should know.

There's really no easy way
to say this.

I've decided to break up with Alan.

Is there somebody else?

No, it's just..

you know, things change.
People change.

We didn't change.

So that's it? It's over?

Just like that?

You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and..

- I can go on pretending
- Okay!

No.

That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.

Well, who wants fair?

I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

I can't believe this!

With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.

Yeah, right!

- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.

We're just gonna need a little time.

I understand.

- Wow.
- I'm really sorry.

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

- But I'm a little relieved.
- Relieved?

Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

I just can't stand your friends.

Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

That was fun.

He could row like a Viking.

So how'd it go?

You know.

Did he mention us?

He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

- Rough day, huh?
- You have no idea.

Come here.

- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!

I don't care! I'm weak!

I've gotta have the smoke!

If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

Yeah, all right.

All right, Phoebe?

If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace...

...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

And bigger boobs.

Well, see, you took mine.

What about you?

If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

There's always one guy.

"lf I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "

Hey, Joey.

What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

Probably kill myself.

Excuse me?

If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

Joey, omnipotent.

You are?

Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoretical question.

FRIENDS

How does she do that?

I can't sleep in a public place.

Would you look at her?

She is so peaceful.

What? What? What?
Hi.

It's okay. You just nodded off again.

What's going on?

I got no sleep last night.

My grandmother has a new boyfriend...

and they' re both kind of insecure
in bed,

so And deaf.

They reassure each other
that they' re having a good time.

You have no idea how loud they are.

You can stay with Rachel and me.

Gracias.

- 95, 96, 97.

See, I told you. Less than 100
steps
from our place to here.

You got way too much free time, man.

There's the birthday boy.

Ross, check it out!

Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you

Happy birthday, pal!

We love you, man.

It's funny.
My birthday
was seven months ago.

So?
So you had an extra ticket...

and couldn't decide
who
got to bring a date?

Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

Oh, my God!

Is today the 20th?
 October 20th?

I hoped you wouldn't remember.

What's wrong with the 20th?

Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?

Today's the day Carol and I first...

...consummated our...

... physical relationship.

Sex.

I better pass on the game.

I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

Guys' night out!
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

What are you doing?
I have no idea.

Come on, Ross.

Maybe it will take my mind off it.

Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
You got it.

Look, look, look!

My first paycheck!

Look at the window!

There's my name!
Hi, me!

I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

You worked in a mine?

No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

Isn't this exciting? I earned this.

I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

And it was totally...

... not worth it.

What's FlCA?
Why's he getting all my money?

I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.

This is not that bad.

You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

You can totally,
totally live on this.

By the way, great service today.

- Incredible!
- Excelent!

Hockey!

Hockey!

Rachel?

Oh, my God!

I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

What are you guys doing here?

Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here,

aaand it's true!

Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!

I know. I know! I'm a duplex.

So what's going on with you?

Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

And while we're on the subject of news..

Look, look, I have elbows!

...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!

Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!

We'll take a brief time out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes.

Carol was wearing boots just like those

the night that we...

we first- y'know.

Fact, she, uh... she never took'em off,

'cause we... we...

Sorry. Sorry.

What?

Peach pit.

Yes, Bunny?

Peach pit.

That night we, uh... we had...
Peaches?

Actually, nectarines, but basically...

Could've been a peach.

Then, uh, then we got dressed,

and I... I... I walked her to the...

...the bus stop...

I'm fine.

Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!

What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.

So c'mon, you guys,
tell me all the dirt!

Well, the biggest news is still
you dumping Barry at the altar!

Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.

When are you coming home?
What?

Guys, I'm not.

C'mon, this is us.

I'm not!

This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job...

Waitressing?

Okay, I'm not just waitressing.
I'm.. I, um...

I'm.. I, um...

I write the specials on the specials board,

I take the uh dead flowers
out of the vase...

Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

Well. Your mom didn't tell
us about the blobbies.

Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?

What's that?

Weeeell, it's rum, and...
Okay.

We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight
we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing.

We got some trashy magazines,

we got cookie dough, we got Twister...

Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation!

But, um, I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

But we can prep the guy!

Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.

Oh, God, ask them what they want.

Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

Yes, hold on.

Um, they say there's been some
unusual activity on your account.

But I haven't used my card in weeks!

That is the unusual activity.

Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.

They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay..

they wanna know if I'm okay,
okay, let's see.

Well, let's see,
the FICA guys took all my money,

everyone I know is either getting married,
or getting pregnant,

or getting promoted,
and I'm getting coffee!

And it's not even for me!

So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?

Uh... Rachel has left the building,

can you call back?

Alright, c'mon!

Let's play Twister!

Sorry, sorry...
Uh... oh.

What? There was ice
there that night with Carol?

Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

No, actually I was just saying it
looks like we're not sitting together.

But now you mention it,
there was ice there that night...

It was the first frost...

C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

You should feel great about yourself!
You're doing this amazing independence thing!

Monica, what is so amazing?

I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

You are just like Jack.

...Jack from downstairs?

No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

Ah, the other Jack.

Yeah, right! See, he gave up something,

but then he got those magic beans.

And then he woke up, and there was this,

this big plant outside his window,

full of possibilities and stuff...

And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up  a cow,

I gave up an orthodontist.

Okay, I... I... I know, I know I didn't love him...

Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

But see, it was a plan.
Y'know, it was clear.

It was figured out,
and now everything's just kinda like...

Floopy?

So what, you're not the only one.
I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going.

You've just gotta figure at some point
it's all gonna come together,

and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.

Oh, like that's a word.

Okay, but Monica, what if... what if it
doesn't come together? ...Pheebs?

Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

Okay, see, see, you guys,
what if we don't get magic beans?

I mean, what if all we've got are...

...beans?

Get him! GET HIM! Get him!

Get- YESSS!

Not laughing now, are ya pal!

See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of
toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

Pass it!
Pass it!

He's open!

Shoot! Shoot!
Shoot!

Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

'Scuse me.

It says to call this number if you're not
completely satisfied with this candy bar.

Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

Well, I guess you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

Hold on.

Fill these out, sit over there.

Look, I don't wanna make any trouble,
okay,

but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright?
My face is dented.

Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

Well, how long do you think it'll be?

Any minute now.

I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

No, you were right.

I don't have a plan.

Pizza guy!

Thank God.
Food.

Phoebe?
What?

Do you have a plan?

I don't even have a 'pl'.

Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?

No, no, that's not what we ordered...

We ordered a fat-free
crust with extra cheese.

Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?'

Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

Wait!

Did you say

..."G.Stephanopoulos"?

Yeah. This one goes across the street,
I must have given him yours.

Oh, bonehead, bonehead!

Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean
guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

Yeah, that sounds about right.

Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

And... and a power tie?

No, pretty much just a towel.

Oh God.

So you guys want me to take this back?

Are you nuts?!
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?

Big Bird's friend.

I see pizza!

Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!

Hello? Who are we spying on?

White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

 The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!

Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.

Please tell me it's his mother.

Definitely not his mother.
Oh, no...

Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor...

she's walking... she's walking...

she's going for the pizza...
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

Excuse me,

look, we've been here for over an hour,
and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.

I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...

I know we both said some things

we didn't mean,

but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.

Y'know, I feel like I've lost her...

Light still out?

Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're... napping.

Oh please, they're having sex.

Shut up!

So, whaddya think George is like?

I think he's shy.

Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

And then... when you do...

he's a preppy animal.

I remember the moonlight
coming through the window...

and her face had the most

 incredible glow.

Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling,

you did this part... Could I get some
painkillers over here, please?

He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today?

So you slept with her for
the first time, so what?

You slept with her for
seven years after that.

Look, it's just a little
more complicated...

Well, what? What? What is it?

That she left you? That she likes women?
That she left you for another woman that likes women?

Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the
twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

Then what?

My first time with Carol

was...

What?

It was my first...

time.

With Carol?

So in your whole life,
you've only been with one...

Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake!

There was a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight!

Okay. Okay, I got one.

Do you remember that vegetarian pate

that I made that you loved so much?

Well, unless goose is a vegetable...
ha haaaah!

Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

What?! You slept with Jason?

You'd already broken up.

How long?

A couple hours.

Oh, that's nice!

Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

Anyway...

The valentine Tommy Rollerson
left in your locker was really from me.

Excuse me?!

Hello? Like he was really
gonna send you one?

She was a big girl.

Really. Well, at least 'big girls'

don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

I was laughing! You made me laugh!
There he is! There he is!

Where?

Right... where we've been looking all night!

He is so cute!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel!
Please drop the

Man. Can you believe he's
only had sex with one woman?

I think it's great.

Y'know, it's sweet,

it's romantic...

Really?

No, you kidding? The guy's a freak...

Hey, buddy.

Hi.
Oh, that's attractive.

Oh, I thought you were
great in Silence of the Lambs.

Oh come on, admit it!
All things considered, you had fun tonight.

Fun? Where was the fun?
Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?

Where's my puck?

Oh, ah... the kid has it.
The kid...?

Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.

I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

You gotta do it, man.

Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber,
you're glue, whatever...

can't do it.

Listen, uh... gimme back my puck.

S, claro que s.

'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
No! No!

Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

GIVE ME MY PUCK!!

Now that was fun.

Okay, Right foot red.

Could've played Monopoly,
 but nooooo.

Thanks.

Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue.

Good.

Hello?
Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.

Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

Alright.
Yes, this is Rachel.

Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know,
I... I haven't been using it much.

Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.

Green. To the green.

I've got magic beans.

Never... never mind.

To the left, to the left... aww!

Ohhh... I'm fine.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

Not a big deal? It's amazing.

You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

A bra. Right out the sleeve.

As far as I know,

guys don't do anything 
that comes close. Right?

Come on!

You guys can pee standing up.

We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

Know what blows my mind?

Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

You look down,
and there they are.

How you get any work done
is beyond me.

I don't get how guys can do
so many mean things...

...and not even care.

-Multiple orgasms!
-There you go.

FRIENDS

the east german laundry detergent

Saturday night. The big night!

Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

-No plans, huh?
-Not a one!

Not even breaking up with Janice?

Right, right. Shut up.

Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

You're sitting there with her.
She has no idea.

You finally get up
the courage to do it.

There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

Why do you have to break up with her?

Be a man. Just stop calling.

If you want, I'll do it with you.

She'd feel like
we're ganging up on her.

You dump Janice,
I'll dump Tony.

You're breaking up with Tony?

He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike, I don't know.

Do you want anything else?

You had a nutty, chocolate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that

Nothing. I' m fine.

What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

That guy, he burns me up.

Yeah, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

It was horrible!
He called me "young lady. "

I hate when my father
calls me that.

Did he say
"You' re not up to this" again?

I got the extended version
with choruses of...

... "You'll Never Make it on Your Own. "

Hi, Joey.

Oh, my God! Angela!

Wow! Being dumped
by you agrees with her.

-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

 Yeah. No.

Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.

-Hey, Angela.
-Joey.

You look good.

That's because l' m wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

You don't say.

So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

Guess who's doing laundry there too?

-Who?
-Me!

Was that not clear?

Why don't...?

Why don't I just
join you both there?

Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

Yes. I do have a laundry room
in my building.

But there's a rat problem.

Apparently, they're attracted
to dryer sheets.

They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

...fluffy.

-Anyway, 7-ish?

-Sure.

Forget it. I'm with Bob now.

Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

Bob is great.

He's smart, sophisticated, 
and he has a real job.

You go on three auditions a month
and you' re an actor. Bob...

Come on! We were great together.

And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

Sorry, Joey. You said,
" Let's be friends. "

So guess what?

-What?
-We' re just friends.

Fine. Fine.

Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? As friends.

What "four of us"?

You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend...

...Monica.

I' m telling you,
this guy's perfect for you.

Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

... brother.

He's smart, he's sophisticated...

...and he has a real job.

I go on three auditions a month
and say l' m an actor, but he's...

-God help us.
-What?

Ugly Naked Guy
is laying kitchen tile.

Look, l' m asking a favor here.

If I do this for her brother,

maybe Angela will come back to me.

What's going on?
You go out with tons of girls.

I know, but...

Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

Will you help me? Please?

Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

Hold on, camper.
You've thought this through?

It's laundry.
The thinking-through is minimal.

Just you and Rachel?
Just you two?

This is a date.
You're going on a date.

What are you saying?

I should shave again?
Pick up some wine?

Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

It's the first time she'll see
your underwear. You want it dirty?

And the fabric softener?

Okay, now what is wrong
with my Snuggles?

What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

-I'll pick something else up.
-There you go.

Thank you.

What does Bob look like?
Is he tall, short?

Yep.

Which?

Which what?

You've never met Bob, have you?

No, but...

For all we know, he's horribly...

Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

Where are they?
Where are they?

This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent
a car, run over some puppies.

I don't wanna do that.

-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

I had the most supremely awful day.

That's not good.

Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here?

We got the proofs from the shoot
with the vegetables.

They sucked.

I blew off the afternoon.
I went shopping.

And I got you...

I'm looking. I'm looking.

I' m looking.

-I got you
-What?

-What?
-What did you get me there?

I got you...

...these.

Bullwinkle socks.

-That's sweet.
-I knew you had Rockys.

You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle

...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

Moose and squirrel.

Whatever you want.

I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

No, l' m still working on mine.

That's it?

Yeah, it was really hard.

Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

You weren't there.

Coming through. Move. Move!

Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.

But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

It's pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

What?

No suds, no save, okay?

What's going on?

Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

Was your basket on top?

-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

You know, no suds, no save.

No suds, no... Excuse me.

Hold on a second!

This is my friend's machine.

Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

All right. Show's over.

Nothing to see here.

Okay. Let's do laundry.

That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

Well, that's because you' re
such a sweet, gentle....

Do you? Do you?
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

Rach, are you gonna separate those?

Oh, God.

Am I being a total laundry spaz?

Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

Have you never done this before?

Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

A whole other machine
for your colors.

And a third for your...

...delicates.
That would be your bras...

...and your underpanty things.

These are white cotton panties.

Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

That would be a judgment call.

He's so cute!

Where did you grow up?

-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

-How'd that happen?
-My God!

What?

I suddenly had the feeling

I was falling.

But I'm not.

So, you and Angela, huh?

-Yep. Pretty much.
-You' re a lucky man.

Know what I miss most about her?

That cute nibbly noise

she makes when she eats.

Like a happy little squirrel...

...or a weasel.

I never really noticed.

Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

Monica. Monica is great.

Yeah, she is.

But it's not gonna last.

She's too much for me in bed.

Sexually.

I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

Yeah, isn't he?

It's great to meet aguy who is 
smart and funny

who's emotionally older than 8.

You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

That's nice.

You can. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

Go! Go!

Hi, Janice.

Here we go. I don't think
we should go out anymore.

All right.

Well, there you go.

Stop it, stop it, stop it.

I know this is gonna sound stupid...

...but I feel that if I can do this...

...if I can actually do
my own laundry...

...there isn't anything I can't do.

That does not sound stupid to me.

The first time I had to cook
for myself after Carol left me

I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross....

-Uh-oh.
-What?

Uh-oh...

Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

It's a song.

The laundry song we sing.

Uh-oh! The laundry's done

What's the matter?

Nothing.

The laundry's done

Come on, show me.

It's just that you left a red sock
with your whites, and now...

...everything's kind of pink

Everything's pink?

Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

But it happened to me.

God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

What am I doing?

My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

I can't even do laundry!

Something went wrong

 with Underdog
and they couldn't inflate his head.

So anyway...

...his head is flopping
down Broadway, right?

And I'm thinking

how inappropriate this is.

Something's in my eye. Could we
check it in the light, please?

-Oh, my God!
-What?

Were we at the same table?
It's like...

...cocktails in Appalachia.

They' re close.

Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

Like you've never got
a little rambunctious with Ross.

Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

... not really true' is it?

Who's to say what's true?

What were you thinking?

l'm not proud of this, okay?

Well, maybe I am a little.

-l' m out of here!
-Wait!

You like him. I want her.

He likes you.

Really?

Yeah. If we put our heads together,
between the two of us...

...we can break them up.

I' m sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

I couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

Here's the thing.
We're different.

I'm bing, bing, bing.
You' re boom, boom, boom.

Oh, my God!

I' m so sorry!

Te encuentras bien?

It's just my lens. It's my lens.

I'll be right back.

I hit her in the eye!
In the eye!

This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

Oh, my God!

How many have you had?

I don't know. A million!

Chandler, easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

-l' m fine, l' m fine.
-All right.

l'm not fine. Here she is.

Wait here, okay? Breathe.

How do you do that?

It's like a gift.

We should always break up together.

I'd like that!

The clothes are clean.
That's the important part.

I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

I'm sorry.

Excuse me. We had this cart.

I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

I' m sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

There weren't clothes in it!

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...

...you' re gonna have
to take me with it!

Yes! Did you see that?

You were incredible.

A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you. I could not have
done this without you.

More clothes in the dryer?

-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

-Are you sure you' re okay?
-Yeah.

-Does it still hurt?
-Yeah.

What a neat idea! All your
clothes match. I' m gonna do this.

How'd it go?

Excellent!

We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

What a beautiful story.

I'm fine, by the way.

I'm sorry.

Where's Chandler?

He needed time to grieve.

I' m free! I' m free!

That ought to do it.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

This is so exciting!

You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

The exclamation point scares me.

It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

Magic is about to happen!

Well, Eva...

...we've done
some excellent work here.

And I would have to say...

...your problem is quite clear.

<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

<i>To play with or simply let hang</i>

FRIENDS

I feel violated.

Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

...to have something else to do?

Ross, 10:00.

Is it? It feels like 2.

-No, 1 0:00!
-What?

There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

Hello!

She's amazing!

She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.

Go over.
She's not with anyone.

And what would my opening line be?

Excuse me...

Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.

He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.

You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.

You could be one of those guys.

-You could do that.
-You think?

Absolutely!

I can't believe
I'm considering this.

-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

Here goes.

-Yes?
-Hi. Okay, next word would be...

... Chandler.

Chandler is my name and....

Hi!

Yes, you said that.

Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

What I wanted to say was...

...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

Chandler?

-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

What'd you think?

-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

-You're right.
-We saw your head.

She said yes!
She said yes!

Awful play, man!

Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
and she pronounces my name " Chandler. "

I like that better.
The usher gave me this.

-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!

Based on this play?

Based on this play!

Hey kids!



It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

How was your date, Chandler?

It was unbelievable!

I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!

<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>

None of the bullets hit the engine,

so we made it to the border.

But just barely, and l....

I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

What about you? Tell me a story.

All right, once...

... I got on the subway.

And it was at night...

...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.

Just for the hell of it.

We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

More or less.

Suddenly, we realized we were
in Yemen.

I' m sorry, so "we" is...?

"We" is me and Rick.

Who's Rick?

Who's Rick?

My husband.

-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.

I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?

No, l' m still married.

So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

...sliding your foot so far up my leg

you can count the change in my pocket?

Don't worry.

He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

Ethan? There's an Ethan?

Ethan is my...

...boyfriend.

What?

What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

I suppose, mainly sexual.

Sorry it didn't work out.

What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

Didn't you listen to the story?

Didn't YOU listen? It's twisted!

How could you get involved
with her?

I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

...and none of the responsibility.

This is every guy's fantasy!

-That's not true!
-Ross, is this your fantasy?

No, of course not.

Yeah. Yeah, it is.

You'd go out with someone
going out with someone else?

I couldn't.

Good for you.

When l' m with a woman,
I need to know...

... I' m going out
with more people than her.

You know...

monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

I mean, anthropologically speaking

Fine. Now you'll never know.

We're kidding. Tell us.

-We wanna know.
-Come on!

All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey

Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.

Look! I cleaned!

I did the windows.
I did the floors.

I used all the vacuum attachments
but the round one.

What's it for?

Nobody knows. 
And we're not supposed to ask.

What do you think?

-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

I see you moved the green ottoman.

How did that happen?

I don't know. It looked better there.

And it's an extra seat
around the table.

Yeah, it's interesting.

But you know what? Just for fun...

...Iet's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

Just to compare.

Let's see.

Well, it looks good there too.

Let's leave it there for a while.

I can't believe you moved
the green ottoman.

Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.

She'll scratch your eyes out.

You guys, I am not that bad!

Yeah, you are.

Remember, I lived with you?

You were a little....

That is so unfair!

When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

But hey, I can be a kook!

All right, you madcap gal!

Imagine this.

The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

Why not?

Because you're a kook!

You wait until they send a notice.

I could do that.

Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping

And I buy detergent,

but it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

Why would someone do that?

One might wonder.

A glass is on the table with no coaster.

 A cold drink. A hot day.

Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood...

Stop it!

Oh, my God!

It's true. Who am l?

Monica, you're Mom.

Oh, my God!

Okay, I'll be there.

That was my agent.

My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

That's great!

What's the part?

Can you believe it? Pacino!

This guy's why I became an actor!

" Out of order? You' re out of order!

This whole courtroom's out of order! "

Seriously, what's the part?

"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! "

Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?

You' re.... What?

I' m his butt double, okay?

I play Al Pacino's butt.

All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

... I' m his butt.

Oh, my God!

Come on, you guys.

It's a real Pacino movie
and that's big!

It's terrific. You deserve this.

After years of struggling you've

cracked your way into show business.

Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

This is a big break for me!

So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

Today's the big day!

God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

Don't ever tell me what you did
in there.

Thank you.

-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.

-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.

My eyes!
My eyes!

I warned you.

Who is being loud?

Oh, that would be Monica.

Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

You got the whole night?

Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

Do I sense resentment?

No. No resentment. Believe me...

...it's worth it, okay?

In a relationship, you have moments

you'll remember the rest of your life.

Every single second is like that
with Aurora.

I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

The old Monica would remind you...

...to scrub that Teflon pan with
a plastic brush.

But l' m not gonna do that.

Everybody ready?

I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

Lose the robe.

Me?

That would work.

Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

Okay, and the robe is lost.

I would like to get this in one take.

Let's roll it.

Water's working.

And action!

And cut!

Butt guy, what are you doing?

I'm showering.

No, that was clenching.

The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

I think his butt would be angry here.

I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

Once again, rolling.
Water working.

And action!

And cut!

What was that?

I was going for quiet desperation.

But if you have to ask....

God, I love these fingers.

Thank you.

No, actually, I meant my fingers.

Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!

-Don't go.
-Okay.

-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

I thought you talked to Rick.

It's not Rick.

Ethan? He gets the whole day!

No, it's Andrew.

I know there'll be moments...

...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

And Andrew is?

He's...

... new.

So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

No, that's not exactly what I was

Most women would kill...

...for three guys like us.

So, what do you want?

You.

-You have me.
-No. Just you.

What do you mean?

Lose the other guys.

Like, all of them?

Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?

Can't we have what we have now?

Why can't we talk and make love...

...without feeling obligated
to each other?

Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

Well, part of me wants that...

... but it's like l' m two guys.

One guy's saying, "This is great! "

But there's this other guy.

The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

...and breaks that measuring device.

He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out! "

So, which one of the guys
will you listen to?

I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

Which one?

The second guy.

I see.

Call me if you change your mind.

Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

Look at it this way. You dumped her!

Right? I mean, this woman was

unbelievably sexy...

...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.

Tell me why you did this again?

Movie star!

Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

Nope.

No? What happened, big guy?

Big guy?

It felt like a "big guy" moment.

I got fired!

They said I acted too much with it.

I told everybody about this!

Everybody's expecting to see me.

No one will be able to tell.

My mom will.

There's something so sweet

and disturbing about that.

I've done crappy plays
for six years...

...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

Maybe this wasn't it.

I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

Did it feel like your shot?

Hard to tell. I was naked.

I don't think this was it.

I don't think you just get one.

I believe things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

You've got to think about
the day some kid will go:

"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass! "

You think? That's so nice.

I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

Good night.

You' re gonna leave
your shoes out here?

Really? Just casually
strewn about...

...in that reckless, haphazard manner?

It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

Whenever.

She is a kook.

<i>If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.</i>

<i>No, don 't do this!</i>

<i>This is stupid!</i>

<i>I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.</i>

<i>But then everyone will know..</i>

<i>Unless I get them, then wake up
really early and put them back.</i>

<i>I need help!</i>

Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

Does it get better than this?

Question: You're not dating, are you?

I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

You see, perfect might be a problem.

Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

He is cute.

-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

Well, yeah.

Oh, God!

I just--

You're nice-- Oh, God.

Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

Okay. Bye-bye.

The One Where Nana Dies Twice

GELULA & CO., INC.

It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

Can you believe she actually
thought that?

When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

. . .possibly. . .

. . .you might be.

You did?

Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

. . .so then I figured maybe not.

Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

-I did.
-I think so.

-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

You're kidding.

-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

. . .who also liked her.

Well, this is fascinating.

So what is it about me?

I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

Yeah, right!

What is it?

I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah, a quality.

''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

It's Paolo calling from Rome.

Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

Just gotta go to Rome.

Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

I'm talking to Rome.

I'm talking to Rome.

Hey, Dad. What's up?

Oh, God.

Ross, it's Nana.

-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

How's she doing?

The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

I'm glad you're here.

What's with your hair?

What?

What's different?

Nothing.

Oh, maybe that's it.

She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

Okay, relax.

We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

Oh, God!

The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

Yeah, they were gross.

You know what I love?

Her Sweet 'N Lows.

How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

Mrs. Geller?

She looks so small.

I know.

Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

Goodbye, Nana.

Bye, Nana.

Nurse!

What is going on?

You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

Well, she's not quite.

What?

She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

What's going on?

She may have died.

''She may have died''?

We're looking into it.

I'll go see.

This almost never happens.

Now she's passed.

I just have to know, okay?

Is it my hair?

Yes, that's exactly what it is.
It's your hair.

Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

So did she. . .?

Twice.

Oh, that sucks.

You guys okay?

I don't know. It's weird.

I know she's gone,
but I just don't feel. . . .

Maybe she's not really gone.

No, no, she's gone.

We checked.

A lot.

No, I mean, maybe no one
ever really goes.

Ever since my mom died,
every now and then. . .

. . .I get this feeling that she's,
like, right here, you know?

And Debbie, my best friend
from junior high. . .

. . .got struck by lightning
on a miniature golf course.

I always get this strong
Debbie vibe. . .

. . .whenever I use
a little yellow pencil.

I miss her.

Here, Pheebs.

Want this?

-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

I just sharpened her this morning.

I don't believe any of that.
I think when you're dead. . .

. . .you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

So Chandler looks gay, huh?

I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

I thought it'd be a closed casket.

Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

I don't see why not.

Here's my retainer!

I was just thinking. . .

-. . .when my time comes--
-Dad!

Listen to me!

When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

You what?

I wanna be buried at sea.
It looks like fun.

Define ''fun. ''

Come on. You'll make a day of it.
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch. . . .

And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

Everyone thinks they know me.

Everyone says, ''Jack Geller,
so predictable. ''

Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
''Buried at sea? Huh. ''

That's probably what they'll say.

I'd like that.

Hey, gorgeous.

Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

Don't worry about it. Apparently,
other people have made the same mistake.

Okay. Phew!

So what do you think it is about me?

I don't know what.

You just have. . .

-. . .a quality.
-A quality. Great.

It's a shame, because you and Lowell
would've made a great couple.

Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
That's who you saw me with?

What? He's cute.

Well, yeah.

He's no Brian in Payroll.

Is Brian. . .?

I don't know. The point is,
if you were gonna set me up. . .

. . .I'd like to think it'd be
with somebody like him.

I think Brian's
a little out of your league.

Excuse me. You don't think
I could get a Brian?

Because I could get a Brian.
Believe you me.

I'm really not.

This one?

I've shown you every dress we have.

Unless you want her to spend eternity
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit. . .

. . .go with the burgundy.

Whatever we pick, she would've
told us it's the wrong one.

You're right.
We'll go with the burgundy.

A fine choice. I'm coming out.

Wait! We need shoes.

How about these?

That's really a day shoe.

And where she's going,
everyone else will be dressier?

Could we see something
in a slimmer heel?

I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

I can show you something
in a silver that may work.

No, it really should be burgundy.

Unless we go with a different dress.

No, no, no. Watch this.

Wait, I may have something in the back.

Oh, my God.

Is everything all right?

Just Nana's stuff.

How we doing?
You guys ready?

Mom called to remind me
not to wear my hair up.

Did you know my ears were not
my best feature?

Some days it's all I can think about.

Hi! I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my bearings.

You mean your earrings?

What did I say?

-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

What? We don't have shoes here?

Morning. We ready to go?

Don't we look nice all dressed up?

It's stuff like that, isn't it?

-It was a really beautiful service.
-It really was.

Come here, sweetheart.

You know. . .

. . .I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

What?

Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds
remarkably like Brent Musburger.

Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

You're watching football at a funeral?

No, it's the pregame.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

You're a frightening, frightening man.

Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

I hope they're not ruined.

God, what a great day!

What? Weatherwise.

I know.

The air, the trees.

Even though Nana's gone,
there's something almost life--

Ross, are you okay?

No, I'm fine.

Just. . .

. . .having my worst fear
realized, but. . . .

I'm just checking to see
if the muscle's in spasm.

-What? What is it?
-You missed a belt loop.

Okay, it's in spasm.

Here, sweetie. Here.

I took these when I had
my golfing accident.

Thanks, Mom.

Sorry.

Hi, I'm Andrea.

I'm Dorothy's daughter.

Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

Look who's up!

How do you feel?

I feel great.

I feel great. I feel great.

Wow, those pills really worked.

Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two. . . .

I love you guys.

You guys are the greatest.
I love my sister.

I love Pheebs.

That's so nice.

I love you, man.

And listen,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

It doesn't matter to me.

You were right.

I love you the most.

Well, you know who I love the most?

You!

Oh, you don't get it!

What do you got there?

Just a hearing disability.

What's the score?

Three minutes to go in the third.

Beautiful!

Pheebs, could you maybe
hand me a cracker?

Your grandmother would've hated this.

Well, sure. What with it
being her funeral and all.

No, I'd be hearing about. . .

. . .why didn't I get
the honey-glazed ham.

Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.
If I spent more, she'd say. . .

. . . ''Why waste your money?
I don't need flowers, I'm dead. ''

That sounds like Nana.

Do you know what it's like
to grow up. . .

. . .with someone who is critical
of every single thing you say?

I can imagine.

I tell you, it's a wonder
your mother turned out. . .

. . .to be the positive,
life-affirming person she is.

That is a wonder!

So tell me something, Mom.
If you had to do it all over again. . .

. . .I mean, if she was here right now. . .

. . .would you tell her?

Tell her what?

How she drove you crazy,
picking on every little detail.

Like your hair, for example.

I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

Would things have been better
if you'd just told her the truth?

I think some things are
better left unsaid.

I think it's nicer when people
just get along.

More wine?

Oh, I think so.

Those earrings look
really lovely on you.

Thank you.

They're yours.

Actually, they were Nana's.

Now I'm depressed!

Even more than I was.

Hey, who's this little naked guy?

That little naked guy would be me.

Look at the little thing!

Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

Can we be grownups now?

Who are those people?

Got me.

That's Nana right there in the middle.

Yeah, let's see.

''Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ''

Monica, you look just like
your grandmother.

How old was she there?

Let's see, '' 1 939. ''

Twenty-four, twenty-five.

It looks like a fun gang.

Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked!

Let me see!

No, no. That would be me again.

I'm just trying something.

Hey, Lowell.

Oh, hey, Chandler.

So how's it going in
Financial Services?

It's like Mardi gras without
the papier-mch heads.

How about you?

Good. Good. Listen. . .

. . .I don't know what Shelly told you
about me, but. . .

. . .I'm not.

I know. That's what I told her.

Really?

So you can tell?

Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

So you don't think I have. . .

. . .a quaIity?

Speaking for my people,
I'd have to say no.

By the way, your friend, Brian,
from Payroll? He is.

He is?

And way out of your league.

Out of my league!

I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

Hey, Brian.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

Dehydrated Japanese noodles
under fluorescent lights.

Does it get better than this?

Question: You're not dating, are you?

I met somebody who would be
perfect for you.

You see, perfect might be a problem.

Had you said co-dependent
or self-destructive. . . .

-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, please.

He is cute.

-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

Well, yeah.

Oh, God!

I just--

You're nice-- Oh, God.

Good, Shelly. I'm gonna go
flush myself down the toilet now.

Okay. Bye-bye.

The One Where Nana Dies Twice

MORPZ fuckyeah. Inc.

It's hard to enjoy Ramen noodles
after that. Is that ridiculous?

Can you believe she actually
thought that?

When I first met you,
I thought maybe. . .

. . .possibly. . .

. . .you might be.

You did?

Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
party talking to my breasts. . .

. . .so then I figured maybe not.

Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

-I did.
-I think so.

-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

Although back in college,
Susan Saladore did.

You're kidding.

-Did you tell her I wasn't?
-No.

It's because I wanted
to go out with her too.

So I told her, actually,
you were seeing Bernie Spellman. . .

. . .who also liked her.

Well, this is fascinating.

So what is it about me?

I don't know. Because you're smart,
you're funny. . . .

So is Ross.
You ever think that about him?

Yeah, right!

What is it?

I don't know. You just--
You have a quality.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah, a quality.

''A quality. '' Good. I was worried
you were gonna be vague about this.

It's Paolo calling from Rome.

Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

So he's calling from Rome.
I could do that.

Just gotta go to Rome.

Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

I'm talking to Rome.

I'm talking to Rome.

Hey, Dad. What's up?

Oh, God.

Ross, it's Nana.

-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

How's she doing?

The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

I'm glad you're here.

What's with your hair?

What?

What's different?

Nothing.

Oh, maybe that's it.

She's unbelievable.
Her mother's--

Okay, relax.

We are gonna be here a while,
it looks like.

We still have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

Oh, God!

The fuzzy little mints
at the bottom of her purse.

Yeah, they were gross.

You know what I love?

Her Sweet 'N Lows.

How she was always stealing them
from restaurants.

Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

Mrs. Geller?

She looks so small.

I know.

Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt Phyllis now.

Goodbye, Nana.

Bye, Nana.

Nurse!

What is going on?

You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

Well, she's not quite.

What?

She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

What's going on?

She may have died.

''She may have died''?

We're looking into it.

I'll go see.

I just have to know, okay?

Is it my hair?

Yes, that's exactly what it is.

You're worm food.

So Chandler looks gay, huh?

I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

I thought it'd be a closed casket.

Well, that doesn't mean
she can't look nice.

Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

I don't see why not.

Does anybody need coffee?

The One Where Underdog Gets Away

English Subtitles by
MORPHZ fuckyeah.

Excuse me, sir?

You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

Only 98.50 to go!

Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

What? No, they're not.

The Blymans invited them.

You're wrong.

I am not wrong.

You're wrong.

No, I just talked to them.

I'm calling Mom.

And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

. . .man/woman. ''

What were you modeling?

You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

The asthma guy's really cute.

Know which one you're gonna be?

But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

Thanks.

You were right.
How can they do this to us?

It's Thanksgiving!

How about if I cook dinner at my place?

I'll make it just like Mom's.

Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

They're not actually supposed to--

I'll work on the lumps.

Joey, you're going home, right?

Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

Yes. Every single one of them.

-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

So you're free Thursday, then?

Yeah. Oh, can I come?

Rach, you still going to Vail?

Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

Only $ 1 02 to go.

I thought it was 98.50?

Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

Well, I'm off to Carol's.

Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

Is Carol here?

No, she's at a faculty meeting.

I just came by to pick up my skull.

Well, not mine, but. . . .

Come in.

Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

What's it look like?

Kind of like a big face without skin.

I'm familiar with the concept.

You can just look for it.

You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

You know, you have to take a course.

Otherwise they don't let you do it.

Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

The baby that hasn't been born yet?

Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

. . .crazy?

What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

You're not serious? I mean. . .

. . .you really talk to it?

Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

Do you talk about me?

All the time.

Really?

We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

Not that I believe any of this.

I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

Here's your mail.

Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

Here's your mail!

Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

Would you just open it!

Oh, my God!

You guys are great!

We all chipped in.

We did?

You owe me $20.

Thank you. Thank you so much!

Chandler, here you go.

Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

What is it with you
and this holiday?

I'm 9 years old.

I hate this story!

We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

Oh, my God!

Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

We used to work together.

We did?

At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

I was the Aramis guy.

Aramis? Aramis?

Yeah, right!

You're the best in the business.

-Get out!
-I'm serious!

You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

Nothing.

Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

Yeah, that would be--

-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

What?

Leave.

Wait, wait, wait!

I guess you all saw it.

Saw what?

We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

Looking good! Okay!

Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

What?

I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

Well, that's closer.

I got the tickets!

Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

Oh, you must stop shooping.

I'm gonna get my stuff.

Will you just come in, already?

I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

That's not a question.

But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

I mean it's. . .

. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

All right. Fine.

Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

. . .and in the form of Tots.

I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

Mom never hit.

Okay, all done.

Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

Ross needs lumps!

Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

Why would we do that?

Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

. . .before she died.

Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

Goodbye, you guys!

Thanks for everything!

Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

The balloon?

No, the actual cartoon character.

Of course the balloon!

It's all over the news.

He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

I can't. I gotta go!

An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

Almost never.

Got the keys?

Anytime you're ready!

Okay, here we go.

Where am I talking to here?

There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

Just aim for the bump.

Okay, here goes.

You know, I can't do this.

It's too weird. I feel stupid.

It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

Hello, baby!

--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

. . .and juicy on the inside.

Why are we standing here?

We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

No, I don't.

Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

No, I didn't. I asked. . .

. . . ''Got the keys?''

You said, ''Got the keys! ''

Either of you have the keys?

The oven is on!

I've gotta get my ticket!

Wait! We have a copy of your key.

Then get it!

That tone won't make me go any faster.

That one will.

And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

How's it going?

Here we come

Walking down the street

Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

Hey, hey--

-Did you feel that?
-I did.

-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

Keep singing! Keep singing!

Hey, hey, you're my baby

And I can 't wait to meet you

When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

I felt it that time!

Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

I'm the one without any breasts

Not that one.

Can you go any faster?

I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

For an emergency just like this.

All right. Listen, smirky!

If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

I swear you said you had the keys!

I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

I obviously did not have the keys!

That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

Why would I have the keys!

Besides the fact that
you said you did?

-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

-Why?
-Because!

Because everything's
my responsibility?

Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

The turkey's burnt!

Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

Here we come

Walking down the--

This doesn't smell like Mom's.

It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

God, this is great!

The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

Oh, really?

So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

You call that delicious?

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

What?

Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

Oh, my God! He's not alone.

Ugly Naked Guy. . .

. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

I gotta see this!

All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

Ugly naked dancing!

It's nice that he has someone.

Shall I carve?

By all means.

Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

You guys have to make a wish.

Make a wish?

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

The bigger half.

All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

A little toast here. Ding, ding!

This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

. . .but for me this has
been really great.

I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

. . .or projectile vomiting.

If you had gone to Vail. . .

. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

. . .I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

Here's to a lousy Christmas!

And a crappy New Year!

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

Wait, wait. What is that?

That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

No, I don't.

He is precious!
Where did you get him?

My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

That is so cruel.

Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!

Is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so. . . .

Why don't you just get a roommate?

I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .

. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--

Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
Sanskrit for ''cool way to live. ''

The One With the Monkey

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

I'm doing all-new material tonight.

I have 12 new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

Might want to open with the snowman.

So how'd it go?

I didn't get the job.

How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!

I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

What are you gonna be?

I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

Hey, what? What is wrong
with New Year's?

Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure. . .

. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!

Man, I'm talking loud!

For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

Yeah, you wish.

I'm sick of being a victim
this Dick Clark holiday.

I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

Just the six of us. Dinner.

-Sure.
-Fine.

I was hoping for a little
more enthusiasm.

You're on.

Oh, good.

Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand. . .

. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.

Thanks. Hi.

I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

I made a man with eyes of coal

And a smile so bewitchin '

How was I supposed to know

That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

My mother's ashes

Even her eyelashes

Are resting in a little yellow jar

And sometimes when it's freezing

I feel a little sneezy

And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?

Noisy boys.

Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

No, that's okay.

If it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing. . .

. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

That guy's going home with a note.

-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?

Sorry.

I was saying you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

And you said Daryl Hannah. . .

. . .was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.

-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way. . .

. . .you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

Then that's when you started yelling.

Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

Did I just share too much?

Just a smidge.

David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

I think it's romantic.

Me too!

Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

I just want to be
with him all the time.

You know, day and night.
And night and day.

And special occasions.

I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

You'll break the pact.
She's breaking the pact.

Yeah, could I just. . .?

Yeah, because I already asked Janice.

Come on, this was a pact!
This was your pact!

I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!

But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!

I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

Hi, sorry I'm late.

Too many jokes.

Must mock Joey.

Nice shoes, huh?

God, you're killing me!

He's playing with my spatulas again!

Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

Do you always have to bring him here?

I didn't want to leave him alone.

We had our first fight this morning.

It has to do with my working late.

I said some things that I didn't mean.

He threw some feces.

If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

That would be great!

But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .

. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.

Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

But you can't actually
test this theory.

Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .

. . .to simulate these conditions.

All right. I have a question then.

Were you planning on kissing me ever?

That's definitely a valid question. . .

. . .and the answer. . .

. . .would be yes.

Yes, I was.

But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .

. . .that happened at this
phenomenal moment because it's you.

Sure.

Right. But the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .

. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

Oh, David, I think you are
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''

I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

-Really.
-I'm sure of it.

You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

Now?

Right now. Just. . . .

You know what?
This is just really expensive.

And this was a gift.

-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?

-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.

Tell me something, what does
''No-Date Pact'' mean to you?

I'm sorry. It's just that Chandler
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

You know more than one Fun Bobby?

I happen to know a Fun Bob.

Okay. Here we go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.

There. Now there is.

So on our no-date evening, three
of you now are gonna have dates.

-Four.
-Four.

-Five.
-Five.

Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

What's an elf to do?

So I'm gonna be the only one standing
there alone when the ball drops?

Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

This is so not what I needed now.

What's the matter?

Oh, it's Marcel.

He keeps shutting me out.

He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

That's weird. I had a blast
with him the other night.

-Really?
-We played. We watched TV.

That juggling thing is amazing.

What juggling thing?

With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

And a melon.

-Phoebe! Hi!
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

No. Have you seen David?

No, he hasn't been around.

If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

Minsk?

Minsk. It's in Russia.

I know where Minsk is.

We got the grant!

Three years, all expenses paid.

So when do you leave?

January 1 st.

-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!

It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

Tell her, David.

''I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''

Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

So you're really not going?

I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just. . . .

You decide.

-Don't do that.
-Please?

But I'm asking you.

I can't make a decision.

-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.

-Stay.
-Stay.

Getting so good at that!

It was Max's stuff.

I love this artichoke thing.

Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

You remember Janice.

Vividly.

Hi, I'm Sandy.

Sandy, hi. Come on in.

You brought your kids.

Yeah. That's okay, right?

Party!

That thing is not coming in here!

''That thing''? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here. . .

. . .like nothing happened. . . .

All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

All right. . .

. . .I'll catch up with you later.

Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .

. . .are you okay?

Where's Paolo?

Rome.

Jerk missed his flight.

And then your face exploded?

I was at the airport
getting into a cab. . .

. . .when this woman. . .

. . .this blond planet
with a pocketbook. . .

. . .starts yelling at me.

Something about how
it was her cab first.

The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

And I started blowing my attack
whistle thingy. . .

. . .and then three more cabs show up.

So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

Everybody having fun at the party?

Are people eating my dip?

When I saw you at the store
last week. . .

. . .it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

Wow, that's dirty!

Hey, kids.

Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me. . .

. . .but at least check in.

There you are!

You got away from me.

But you found me.

Here, Ross, take our picture.

Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

Kill me. Kill me now.

Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

Hey, sorry I'm late.

But my grandfather. . .

. . .died about two hours ago.

But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .

. . .here I am.

Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?

Whoa! Who died?

It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

So at least I'll get to see him again.

I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

All right, Janice, that's it!

When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--

Oh, no!

-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!

You listen to me!
You listen to me!

One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

Will you give me the thing?

Hi, Max.

Yoko.

I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

It won't be the same. . .

. . .but it will still be Minsk.

Happy New Year.

Are you all right?

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

You're going to Minsk.

No, I'm not going to Minsk.

Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

That's what I have to do now. ''

And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

And then you say,
''It's tearing me apart. . .

. . .but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

And I say, ''No!

No! I can't understand that! ''

Sorry.

And then you put
your arms around me. . . .

Put your arms around me.

Sorry.

And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

I'll never forget you.

Then you say that it's almost
midnight and you have to go. . .

. . .because you don't want to start
the year with me if you can't finish it.

I'm gonna miss you. . .

. . .you scientist guy.

Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

It gets better every year.

Here you go, kids.

And then the peacock bit me.

Please kiss me at midnight!

You seen Sandy?

I don't know how to tell you this. . .

. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
on with Max, that scientist geek.

Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

What?

The ball is dropping!

In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

And the moment of joy is upon us.

Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.

Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!

--four, three, two. . .

. . .one! Happy New Year!

I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz. . .

. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

I can't kiss anyone.

So I'm kissing everyone?

You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

Somebody kiss me.

Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

All right! All right! All right!

There!

I wanted this to work so much.

I'm still in there, you know?

Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

But he's just phoning it in.

It's hard to accept
that something you love so much. . .

. . .doesn't love you back, you know?

I think that bitch cracked my tooth.



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

Oh, my God! Don't look now.
Behind you there's a guy. . .

. . .who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

Where?

Come to Mama!

He's coming!
Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

-We should do something. Whistle.
-We're not whistling.

Come on, do it!

Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

I can't believe you did that!

The One With Mrs. Bing

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Why did I woo-hoo?

Was I hoping he'd turn around and say. . .

. . . ''I love that sound.
I must have you now''?

I just wish there was something
we could do.

Hello, coma guy.

Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

What are you doing?

Maybe nobody's tried this.

I wish we at least knew his name.

Look at that face.

I mean, even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

And he can dance!

And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening. . .

. . .not saying, ''I understand'' . . .

. . .but really wondering
what you look like naked.

I wish all guys could be like him.

I know.

Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

He doesn't have anyone.

We feel kind of responsible.

I can't believe you said, ''Woo-hoo! ''

I don't even say, ''Woo-hoo! ''

Oh, she's coming up!

When we come back, we'll talk with
the always-interesting Nora Tyler Bing!

Put the kids to bed for this one.

Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's
is on Showtime and HBO!

No way!

Come on! She's your mom!

Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

I gotta tell you, I love
your mom's books! I love them!

I cannot get on a plane without one.
This is so cool!

You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 1 1 . . .

. . .and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

I love your mom!
I think she's a blast!

You can say that.
She's not your mom.

Oh, please! She's the--

Hi, sweetie!

When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

-Last night.
-Really?

So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

Just a dream I had.

But. . . .

Hey, hey, hey! She's on!

Nora Bing!

Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

Your mom was arrested?

I'm busy beaming with pride.

This is kind of embarrassing...

...but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man...

Why would she say that's embarrassing?

...I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.

That's too much information!

So now you're doing this book tour.
How's that going?

Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

But I get to see my son, who I love!

This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom somehow.

-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom!

I bought my son his first condoms.

And then he burst into flames.

Let's see. ''Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

The high today was 45. ''

Teams played sports.

What about Glen?

He could be a Glen.

Not special enough.

How about Agamemnon?

Way too special.

I'm famished. What do I want?

Please, God, don't let it be
Kung Pao chicken.

You watched the show!
What did you think?

I think you need to come out
of your shell.

What is this dive?

Only you could've picked this place.

Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

-I think we're ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

There you go. Ross?

I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

Hi! Sorry we're late.

We kind of just, you know,
lost track of time.

But a man can change.

Anyone want me to appraise anything?

Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've ever written.

When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
all I wanted to do was become a writer.

Oh, please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

Start with half a dozen
European cities. . .

. . .throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia. . .

. . .and you have got yourself a book!

My mother, ladies and gentlemen!

Yeah, any messages for room 226?

-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

What is with you tonight?

Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

Okay, thank you.

It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

No. It's the one he's licking.

She's supposed to be with you.

You're good.

I have sold 100 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo.

People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

When?

He's not a hero.

You know who our hero is?

The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

No, it's you.

-Please.
-No, really.

Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

-Right.
-Come on, kiddo.

You're gonna be fine, believe me.

I'll just pee in the street.

Is Chandler here?

Wait. Come here.

Okay, about last night. . .

. . .you know. . .

. . .Chandler, you didn't tell. . . .

We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

Right. No big deal.

In Bizarro-world!

You broke the code!

-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

But not a mom. Never a mom!

What are you guys doing out here?

Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

But apparently somebody overslept.

Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.

No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

Well, you didn't call
and leave your grip size.

You guys are spending
way too much time together.

I'm scum. I'm scum.

-How could you let this happen?
-I don't know.

It's not like she's a regular mom.

She's sexy. She's. . . .

You don't think my mom's sexy?

Well, not in the same way.

I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

What are you doing here?

Not playing racquetball.

-He forgot to leave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

Sounds like you two have issues.

Goodbye, baby.

Do they wait for me to do this?

-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

How about, because if you don't,
his mother might?

What are you guys doing here?

He's not even wearing a jock strap!

What did I ask?

What are you doing here?

Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after. . .

. . .that I, you know.

So what are you doing here?

I'm not really here.

I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

Do you come here a lot. . .

. . .without me?

No, no, no.

Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

How would I know? I wasn't here.

Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

Oh, my God!

You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

I can't believe it.

Paolo kissed my mom?

I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

I mean, you know how he gets
when he's drunk--

I can't do this. I did it.

It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

What?

I was upset about Rachel and Paolo
and I had too much tequila, and Nora. . .

. . .Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was. . .

. . .just being nice.
But nothing happened.

Nothing. Ask Joey.

Joey came in--

You knew about this?

You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

You're lucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

Thanks, man. Big help.

I can't believe this!
What were you thinking?

I wasn't. I don't know. I--

No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

-I know.
-I can't believe you did this!

-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you for not telling me.

-What are you mad at me--?
-Let me slam the door!

I didn't kiss her. He did. See
what happens when you break the code?

''A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Greene. ''

I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

Do you think his ''love stick'' can be
''liberated from its denim prison''?

Yeah, I'd say so.

And there's no ''j'' in ''engorged. ''

Hey, Rach.

-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

No. You?

You just asked me.

Maybe it was a trick question.

Rachel, can we do this now?

I am so hot!

Here's my mother and father
on their wedding day.

Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

I cannot believe this conversation.

Just try to picture her not pregnant.

Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

Thanks.

I'd like to start with a song
about a man I recently met. . .

. . .who's come to be
very important to me.

You don 't have to be awake
To be my man

Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

Though we just met the other day

There's something I have got to say

Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started--

I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

''Mother-kisser. ''

I'll shut up.

Chandler, I know
you're still mad at me. . .

. . .but there were two people
there that night.

-There were two sets of lips.
-I expect this from her.

She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

If she always behaves like this,
why don't you say something?

Because it's complicated.
It's complex!

Hey, you kissed my mom!

We're rehearsing a Greek play.

That's funny.
Are we done now?

You mean you're not gonna
tell her how you feel?

No. Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom. . .

. . .doesn't mean you know her.
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

Okay, that's my finger.

Okay, that's my knee.

Still doing the play.

What did you do with him?

-You're awake!
-Look at you!

How do you feel?

A little woozy, but basically okay.

Gosh, you look good!

I feel good.

Who are you?

-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe Buffay.

I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

We both have.

-The Etch A Sketch is from you guys?
-Actually, from me.

-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

I read to you.

I sang.

Well, thanks.

-Oh, my pleasure.
-You're welcome.

So I guess I'll see you around.

What? That's it?

''See you around''?

-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

Maybe. . .

. . . ''That was nice. ''

''It meant something to me. ''

''I'll call you. ''

-All right. I'll call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

This is so typical.

You know, we give. . .

. . .and we give. . .

. . .and we give.

And then we just get nothing back.

And then one day, it's just,
you wake up, and ''See you around. ''

Let's go, Phoebe.

You know what?
We thought you were different.

But I guess it was just the coma.

The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

All right. Well, be good.
I love you.

You kissed my best Ross!

Or something to that effect.

Look, it was stupid.

-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

And I don't even know how it happened.

I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

Are we okay now?

No.

The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

He told her off. And not just
about the kiss, about everything!

You're kidding?

He said, ''When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?''

Then she came back with. . .

. . . ''The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?''

Are you sure she didn't say. . .

. . . ''When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?''

That makes more sense.

You think?

What's going on now?

I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

I don't hear anything. Wait!

What do you see?

It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

Wait, wait, wait!

They're walking away.
They're walking away.

No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run, run!

Are you okay, kiddo?

Yeah, I'm okay.

All right. You be good.

Drive safe.

-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

You mean that?

Yeah, why not?

So I told her.

-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

Couldn't have gone worse.

Well, how do you feel?

Pretty good.

I told her.

Well, see?

So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
me kissing your mom, huh?

But we don't have to
go down that road.

This is just the first chapter. . .

. . .and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts. ''

What's a ''niffle''?

You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

All right, so I'm not a great typist.

Wait, did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those!

That's it. Give them back!



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
No, no, we're done!

The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna. . .

. . .I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

The meat's only every third layer.

Maybe you could scrape.

Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass. . .

. . .and I could find my way
out like that!

This is cool.

It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

And we're done with the yogurt.

Sorry.

Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

Ross, listen.

Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy. ''

Hello.

''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

''What's a lesbian?''

Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

It's like ''poke a nose. ''

Poke a nose.

So did I hear ''Poconos''?

My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

First weekend away together.

-Yeah, it's a big step.
-I know.

It's just a weekend.
Big deal.

Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

Shouldn't it be. . .

. . .flung by now?

We are way past the ''fling'' thing.

I'm feeling things I've only
read about in Danielle Steel books.

When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally. . . .

Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

I could call Immigration.

I love babies with
their little baby shoes. . .

. . .and their little baby toes
and their little hands. . . .

You're gonna have to stop that. . .

. . .forever.

Need a new table.

You think?

-Come on in.
-Hello.

I brought the books. . .

. . .and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

Great!

Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

I'm pretty sure that it is.

So I got the results
of the amnio today.

Tell me.
Is everything. . .?

Totally and completely healthy.

That's great! That is great!

When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

That's our friend Tanya.

Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

The sex?

I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

But when you throw in Tanya. . . .

The sex of the baby, Ross.

You know it?

Do you want to know?

I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there. . .

. . .and see,
''Oh, there it is. . . ''

. . .or isn't.

-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

So?

So did you hear?

Yes, we did.
Everything's A-OK.

Oh, that's so cool!

It really is.

Do we know?

We certainly do.
It's going to be a--

Hello?

A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

What. . .?

What did we think it'd be?

I don't want to know.
Don't want to know.

I should probably just go.

-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.

Susan.

Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

So just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

That's the rule.

What rule?
There's no rule.

If anything, you owe me a table.

How did you get that?

This piece of furniture
was fine. . .

. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

You knew about that?

The impressions you made in the butter
left little to the imagination.

How about if we split it?

What do you mean,
like, buy it together?

Do you think we're ready for that?

Why not?

It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

You'd tell me if you were?

-It's just, with my last roommate--
-I know all about Kip.

We bought a hibachi together,
then he ran off and got married. . .

. . .and things got ugly.

Let me ask you something.

Was Kip a better roommate than me?

Don't do that.

You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

Thanks.

Here comes your 3:00.

I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but-- Yum!

Paolo! Hi!
What are you doing here?

Rachella tell me you. . .

. . .massage?

Well, Rachella's right.

I don't know what you said,
so let's start.

I am. . .

. . .being naked?

That's your decision.

Some people prefer to take off--

Being naked!

I can't believe you don't want to know.
I couldn't not know.

If the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--

And Monica knows.

How could you?
I don't even know.

Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.

I asked. She told me.

So what's it going to be?

Great! Now he knows
and I don't know.

I'm sorry. I'm excited
about being an aunt.

Or an uncle.

Fine!

What's the matter?

Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

Can we get some
cappuccino over here?

Oh, right! That's me!

That table place closes at 7. Come on.

Fine.

What is it?

You know Paolo?

I'm familiar with his work.

He made a move on me.

-The store'll be open tomorrow.
-More coffee.

What happened?

He came in for a massage. . .

...and everything was fine until....

My God!

Are you sure?

Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

Was it. . .?

Boy Scouts could've
camped under there.

''Ooh,'' what?

--ma Thurman.

-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

Thanks, Rach.

-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

You have to! It's your
moral obligation as a friend. . .

. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.

Guys? Guys?

You have to tell her.

Feminist issue?
That's where I went.

She is gonna hate me!

Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

Here, how about that one?

That's patio furniture.

So what?

Like people will come in and think,
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''

Fine.

What about the birds?

I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .

. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''

You pick one.

How about the ladybugs?

So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

Fine! Do you want the birds?
Get the birds!

Not like that, I won't.

Kip would've liked the birds.

Hi, Pheebs.

Are you moving out?

No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

This one's Paolo's.

Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

Sure.

Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.

We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

There are three things
you should know about me.

One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

Two, I never lie.

And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

Thanks, Pheebs.

My God!

Why have I never tasted these before?

I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

You're right. These are
the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

Which proves that I never lie.

I guess you don't.

Paolo made a pass at me.

So what do you think?

It's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

I know.

So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?

Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.

Come on!

Heads up, Ross.

Score!

You suck!

Are you okay?

I need some milk.

I've got milk.

Here you go.

Better?

I feel so stupid!

I think about the other day
with you guys.

And I was all,
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

He makes me feel so--''

God!

I'm so embarrassed!

I'm so embarrassed.

I'm the one he hit on.

Phoebe, I pushed him on you.

If I had never met him,
this would never--

-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

Wait!

-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

Right. He's the pig.

-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .

-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

But he was my pig man!

How did I not see this?

Oh, I know!

Because. . .

. . .he's gorgeous.

And he's charming.

And the way he looks at you--

The end.

God!

Should I not have told you?

Trust me, it's much better
that I know.

But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

I think she took it pretty well.

Paolo's over there right now, so. . . .

We should go
and see if she's okay.

Just one second.

Score!

Game! Us!

Come on.

It looks like
we kicked your butts.

She kicked our butts.

You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

Come on. Two on one.

Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.

It's time for you to swoop in.

What, now?

Now is when you swoop.

When Paolo walks out of there,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

She's got to know
you're everything he's not.

You're like the anti-Paolo.

My Catholic friend is right.

She's distraught.
You're there for her.

You pick up the pieces, and then
you usher in. . .

. . . ''The Age of Ross. ''

Hold it! Ascolta!

-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.

That is either, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts! ''

Here he comes.

I am. . .

. . .to say goodbye.

Okay, bye-bye.

I hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

But I still have five of these. . .

. . .so heat it at 375
untiI the cheese bubbles.

I just wanna tell you. . .

. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .

Just look at her.

Guys, I think only one of us
should go out there. . .

-. . .so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

And I really think it should be me.

You all right?

I've been better.

Come here.

Listen. . .

. . .you deserve
so much better than him.

I mean, you. . .

. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

What?

I'm so sick of guys!

I don't want to look
at another guy.

I don't want to think
about another guy.

I don't even want
to be near another guy.

Ross, you're so great.

-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

Medium.

Any cookies left?

See, Rach. . .

. . .I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

I just need to be
by myself for a while.

I just gotta
figure out what I want.

See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

No, I know. I know.

And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

What?

What?

I'm having a boy?

No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

I'm having a boy.

Am I having a boy?

You're having a boy!

I'm having a boy!

I'm having a boy!

-What?
-What is it?

I'm having a boy!

We already knew that!

I'm having a son.

And that would be a shutdown!

Shutout!

Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game!

It's 2:30 in the morning.

Get out!

You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

Come on, I'll only use
my left hand.

Come on, wussies!

All right! Okay!
I gotta go!

I'm going.

And I'm gone.

One more game?



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
-I'm sorry!
-Oh, my God! That's it!

You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

You have no respect
for my privacy?

-Rachel, wait!
-No, you wait!

Can I just say one thing?

What?! What?

That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your. . .

. . .nippular area.

The One With the Boobies

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Honey, honey. . .

. . .tell them the story about
your patient. . .

. . .who thinks things are
other things.

Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower. . . .

That's pretty much it.

But you tell it really well, sweetie.

Thanks.

Now go away so we can
talk about you.

Okay. I'll miss you.

Isn't he great?

He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

I know. I know.

He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky. You know?

Think you'll do it on his couch?

I don't know. That's a little weird.

It's vinyl. . . .

You guys want anything else?

-Could I have--
-We're all out.

Anybody else?

Did I miss something?

No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

It was an accident.

I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

Can we change the subject, please?

Because, hello? These aren't her
''boobies. '' These are her breasts.

Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

''Nice''?

They were ''nice''?

That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice. ''

Rock, hard place. . .

. . .me.

You're so funny!

He's really funny!

I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

Back up there, sparky.

What did you mean by that?

It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues. . .

. . .that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

Only child, right?

Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

How did you know?

It's textbook.

Hey, you guys.

You all know my dad, right?

-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.

I got a job midtown.

I'm better off
staying with the kid. . .

. . .than going back and forth
on the ferry.

I don't know this one.

This is my friend Roger.

-Good to meet you.
-You too.

What happened to the puppet guy?

Dad!

Excuse me.

So, Ross, how's the wife?


Chandler, quick,
say something funny!

Gotta go.

I miss you too.

I love you,
but it's getting late now--

Let me say hi. Hey, Ma!

Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

Excuse me?

Did you know this isn't Ma?

Her name's Ronni.

She's a pet mortician.

Sure.

So how long have you been. . . .

Remember when you were a kid, we'd
go see the big ships in the navy yard?

Since then?

No, it's only been six years.

I wanted to give you
a nice memory. . .

. . .so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

Joe, have you ever been in love?

I don't know.

Then you haven't.

You're burning your tomatoes.

You're one to talk.

Your dad's in love, bigtime.

And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

It's like if you woke up one day
and found out. . .

. . .your dad was
leading this double life.

He's like actually some spy
working for the CIA.

That'd be cool!

This blows!

I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

Why do they
have to become people?

Why do they have--

Why. . .

. . .can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

What?

What?

Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

We're all adults here.

There's only one way
to resolve this.

Since you saw her boobies. . .

. . .you're gonna have to show her
your pee-pee.

You know,
I don't see that happening.

Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

Well I'm not showing you my tat!

-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

Come on up.

Oh, good! Rog is here!

-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

I hate that guy!

What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

Come on, he's not that bad.

That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her. . .

. . .if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

I don't know.

Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

Why? Why would I?
Why?

I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.

Wait!
Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

Well, I don't know.

It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage. . .

. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

-So you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

That's not what I was saying.

I thought you were on my side. . .

. . .but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .

. . .so they'd favor you.

I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

You're right.

I mean, you're right!

It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace. . .

. . .and the Weeble's Cruise Ship. . .

. . .which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

That's tough, tough stuff.

Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

Feel better, okay?

We're gonna be late, sweetie.

Thanks for everything, Mon.

No problem.

It was great seeing you again.

Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

Remember, they're just food. . .

. . .they're not love.

I hate that guy!

Good night, you guys.

Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.

Can we help you?

No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

I'm Joey Tribbiani.

Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

Oh, my God!

You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

I'm Ronni.

Cheese nip?

Joey's having an embolism. . .

. . .but I'd go for a nip.

Most people,
when their pets pass on. . .

. . .want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

Like chasing their tail.

Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

That's a good one!

Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

Hello, babe!

What are you doing here?

You left your hair
at my place.

I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.

Thank you.

So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

Look, I. . . .

I shouldn't have come.

I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

Where am I gonna stay?
Here?

We'll go to a hotel.

We'll go to a hotel.

-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

You're gonna keep an eye on us?

Right, mister!

I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .

. . .you're gonna live by my rules.

And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

Wow, he's strict.

Dad, you'll be in my room.

Ronni, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

Thanks.
You're a good kid.

Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''

This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

-Six years is long enough!
-What kind of change?

-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

Hey, kickie!

What are you doing?

Trying to get comfortable.

-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

I've been thinking. . .

. . .about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls. . . .

Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

I always figured, when
the right one comes along. . .

. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.

Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--

You're not him, you're you.

When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

That wasn't easy, but you did it.

And I believe that
when the right woman comes along. . .

. . .you'll have the guts to say:

''No thanks, I'm married. ''

You really think so?

I really do.

-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

May I help you?

Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

Who are you?

Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

The mistress?

-Come on in.
-Thanks.

I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

Say, Ronni. . . .

How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

Like five minutes.

Perfect.

Fasten your seat belts. . .

. . .it's pee-pee time!

Hey, Mr. Trib.

Good morning, dear.

Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing!

Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

How's it going?

Good.

Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

What's going on?

Nothing.

It's just that. . . .

It's Roger.

There's something about--

Basically, we just feel
that he's. . . .

We hate that guy!

We hate him!

We're sorry, Pheebs.

Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive. . .

. . .that it freaked you out?

-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!

I'm sorry.

Ma! What are you doing here?

I came to give you this. . .

. . .and this!

Big ring!

Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

. . .about making things right?

Things were fine the way they were!

There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

For God's sake, Joey!
Really.

Hold on. You knew?

Of course I knew.
What do you think?

Your father is no James Bond.

You should have heard
his cover stories.

''I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's. ''

I mean, what is that?
Please!

So then, how could you--?

Do you remember
how your father used to be?

Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

Now he's happy.

I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but. . .

. . .what the hell
are you saying?

-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

Look, honey. . .

. . .in an ideal world. . .

. . .there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

And I'll tell you something else:

Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along. . .

. . .he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

He's been more loving.

It's like every day is
our anniversary.

I'm happy for you. . .?

Well, don't be!

Because now everything's screwed up.

I just want it the way it was.

Ma, I'm sorry.

I just did what
I thought you'd want.

I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

So tell me. . . .

Did you see her?

You're ten times prettier
than she is.

That's sweet.

Could I take her?

With this ring, no contest!

-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing. . . .

What's wrong? Come on.

It's nothing. I'm fine.

It's just--
It's my friends.

They have a liking problem with you. . .

. . .in that. . .

. . .they don't.

They don't?

But you know. . .

. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

They think you're a little. . . .

What?

Intense and creepy.

But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

You're not?
That's why you're so great.

Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .

. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

You know, this kind of codependent. . .

. . .emotionally stunted. . .

. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups. . .

. . .which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

Love me! I need love! ''

So you talked to your dad?

He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know.

And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore. . .

. . .because he got
a restraining order.

Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

Things have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

So Joey, are you okay?

Yeah, I guess.

It's just--
You know, they're parents.

After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

Even if you know better. . .

. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

And just think. . .

. . .in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

Oh, please!

If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .

. . .chasing after 20-year-old boys. . .

. . .or I'll end up like my mom!

How's it going?

Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

Yeah, right!

What happened?

I don't know. I mean. . . .

He's a good person. . .

. . .and he can be really sweet.

And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

It's just. . . .

I hate that guy!

What's going on?

Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

Next stop, Rachel Greene.

Joey, what the hell were you doing?

Sorry, wrong boobies!

Hello, Joey!

Hello, dear!



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I'm teIIing you, she wants you.

She bareIy knows me.
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

Any contact?

She lent me an egg once.

You're in!

Oh, right.

Come on. You gotta get back
in the game here.

The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you. . . .

I don't think we need a third.

Excuse me. Could we get an egg
still in the shell?

An egg?

Go up to her and say, ''Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. ''

I think it's winning!

I think it's insane.

She'll love it!

-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

Go with the egg, my friend.

Go, go, go!

-Think it'll work?
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

The One With the Candy Hearts

GELULA & CO., INC.

-You cannot do this.
-What? Do what?

Roger wants to take her out.

No! Pheebs! Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

Because he was creepy.

And mean. And a little frightening.

Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

I know I do.

What are you doing tomorrow night?

Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

-Listen, about tonight--
-Don't you dare bail on me!

She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

But her friend sounds like such a--

Pathetic mess. I know, but. . . .

Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable.

I'm thinking. . . .

Thanks.

You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

She said yes.

Way to go, man!

Still got the egg, huh?

How do I look?

I don't care.

There's Lorraine.

Now, remember, no trading.

You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

Well, well!

Look what you brought!

Very nice.

And what did you bring?

She's checking her coat.

I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

Janice?

Oh. . .

. . .my. . .

. . .God!

Hey, it's Janice!

I'm making a break for it!
I'm going out the window!

No, don't, please! I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine!

-Just calm down.
-Calm down? Calm down?

You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months!

Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous. . .

. . .and I can't go when I'm nervous.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?

Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

''Oh, was it good for you?''

Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

''I win! I win! ''

I went out with him for
two months. I didn't get to win once!

How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

There's more beer, right?

Oh! You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle. . .

. . .you can do a cleansing ritual.

Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

Okay, we can burn the stuff
they gave us.

Or. . .?

Or we can chant and dance
around naked, you know, with sticks.

Burning's good.

I've got stuff to burn.

You know. . .

. . .ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

Yeah?

Good for you.

Quarters or rolls of quarters?

By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

That's okay.

Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

We can't do that!

What? What can't you do?

Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

We might be leaving now.

Say it's you and me ''we. ''

She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

I'm not even sure what slathering is!

But I definitely want to be
a part of it!

Okay, you cannot do this to me.

You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

Can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

I'm out of here.

Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry.

I hope she throws up on you.

Thanks.

So. . . .

Just us.

What a crappy night!

Though I've enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out. . .

. . .of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

Excuse me.

How you doing?

So do we have the best friends,
or what?

Joey's not a friend. He's. . .

. . .a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

I will go for that drink.

You got it. Good woman!

A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

Each.

That's right. Each.

And a rob roy.

I've always wanted to know.

Happy Valentine's Day!

Oh, I miss you already.

Can you believe this happened?

No, no!

And yet it did.

-Goodbye, Janice.
-Kiss me!

Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

Hey, Janice.

Hi, Monica.

Okay. Well, this was very special.

Rach, come see who's out here!

What's going on--?
Oh, my God!

Janice! Hi!

Janice is gonna go away now!

I'll be right back.

Joey! Look who it is!

Oh, good! Joey's home now!

This is so much fun!

This is like a reunion in the hall!

Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

He just happened to call.

Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right!
It's me! How did you know?

I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then. . .

. . .because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing. . .

. . .that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles. . .

. . .he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half!

That's funny!

Who are they?

The blond is my ex-wife.

And the woman touching her is her. . .

. . .close personal friend.

You mean they're lovers?

If you want to put a label on it.

-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

I always forget that part.

Hello!

Okay. So now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

That's okay!

All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

Can we start throwing things in?

Yeah, okay!

Okay. Barry's letters.

Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

And I have the receipt
from my dinner with--

-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
-Let me see!

He's wearing a sweater.

Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

Wait! Isn't it almost pure--

How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

Oh, man! In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

Hello, funny valentine!

Hi, just Janice.

Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

I could just kiss you all over
and I'm gonna!

If you don't do it, I will.

So what do you do for a living?

Well, for the past few years,
I've been. . . .

You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

I thought they could!

--working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science. . .

. . .which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

Now, that is funny!

Hey, do you think--

Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

Because she's alone now.

And pregnant. And sad.

-I guess.
-Are you sure?

Thanks. Carol!

Wanna come over and join us?

Oh, no. I'm fine.

Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down.

Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

Let's try scooching! Come on!

-Come on.
-Thank you.

Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

Carol, Kristen.

How do you do?

Carol teaches sixth grade.

And Kristen. . . .

Kristen does something. . .

. . .that, funnily enough. . .

. . .wasn't even her major!

What do we got there?

A piece of silk boxer shorts. . .

. . .some greeting cards. . .

. . .what looks like a
half-charred picture of. . . .

Wow! That guy's hairier
than the chief!

You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

It's all right. Don't explain.

It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
to get out of control.

-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?

Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year!

I brought you something.

Is it loaded?

Oh, little candy hearts!

''Chan and Jan forever! ''

I had them made special.

Okay, Janice.

Janice.

Hey, Janice.

There's no way for me
to tell you this.

At least, no new way
for me to tell you this.

I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

That's fine.

It is?

Because I know that this
isn't the end.

Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

Don't you know it yet?

You love me, Chandler Bing!

Oh, no, I don't.

Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

New Year's, who invited who?

Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

I did, but--

You seek me out!

Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

Janice! Janice!

You want me! You need me!

You can't live without me!

And you know it!

You just don't know you know it.

See you.

Call me!

It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

You did so. I swear.
I swear to--

How long has she been in the bathroom?

I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

Well, maybe it's cold in there.

Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

You know, this is still pretty hot.

Mushroom.

Smile.

They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just. . . .

Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

Well, do I have to?

I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman. . .

. . .and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

But there's. . . .

That's it.

And then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

And I don't have to. . . .

-I know.
-You know?

Here's a wacky thought.

Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

Because we're great together,
you know?

You can't deny it.

And besides, you're carrying my baby.

I mean, how perfect is that?

You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

I love you.

I love you too.

-But--
-No ''but. '' No ''but. ''

You know that thing they
put over here with the pin in it?

It's time to take the pin out.

You'll find someone, I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

Not her.

We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

So will you bring the truck?

I'll even let you ring the bell.

-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

Thanks. See you.

Oh, my God!

See, there you go.

-The cleansing worked.
-You're right!

They're nice guys!

They're firemen guys!

-You tell them you're married?
-No way!

My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them!

Coffee.

-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

And a nice hot cider for Monica.

Thank you.

Rach?

Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

That's why.

Sorry.

The One With the Stoned Guy

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Chandler?

Miss Tedlock, you're looking
lovely today.

May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

If this is about those prank memos,
I had nothing to do with them.

Nothing at all. Really.

Nothing.

Hey, you guys! You guys!

Chandler's coming and he says
he has incredible news.

So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know--

Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

What's going on?

So it's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers. . .

. . .and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

-That is great!
-Congratulations!

So. . .

. . .I quit.

Why?

Why? This was supposed to be
a temp job.

Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

I know, but if I took it, it would
be admitting that this is what I do.

Was it a lot more money?

Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office. . .

. . .worrying about the WENUS.

''The WENUS?''

Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

Oh, that WENUS.

What are you gonna do?

I don't know. That's the thing.

But I won't figure it out
working there.

I have something you can do!

I have this new massage client, Steve.

Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant. . .

. . .and he's looking for a head chef.

Hi, there.

I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so. . . .

I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

What kind of food
is he looking for?

He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone. . .

. . .who can create the entire menu.

-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, I know!

So what do you think?

Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big white hat.

Oh, Monica! Guess what?

Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

I added the ''a-go-go. ''

Career counselor?

Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

I don't.

Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

You know, you have goals,
you have dreams.

I don't have a dream!

The meeting went great?

So great! He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

It's this cute little place on 1 0th.

It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

Anyway, I'm cooking for him
Monday night. Kind of an audition.

He wants you to be here,
which will be great for me.

You can make yummy noises.

-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

I don't know.
It's just got to be great.

I know what you can make!
I know!

You should make that thing
with the stuff.

You know. . .

. . .that thing with the stuff?

Okay, I don't know.

Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

How about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug lady?

I love you, Ross.

Her name's Celia.
She's not a bug lady.

She's curator of insects
at the museum.

What are you gonna do?

I thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place. . .

. . .and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

He's not speaking metaphorically.

So back to your place?
You thinking maybe. . . .

Well, I don't know. . . .

I'm hoping. . . .

I tell you, that monkey's
a chick magnet.

She's gonna look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

Soothing tones, soothing tones.

Here, here.
You want some?

I can't stand this.

He's got his claws on my--

Yeah, all right.

Try this salmon mousse.

Good.

Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

It's creamier.

Yeah? Well, is that better?

I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

God, what happened to you?

Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests. . .

. . .intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

''You're suited for data processing for
a large multi national corporation. ''

That's so great because you
already know how to do that!

Can you believe it?

Don't I seem like I should
be doing something really cool?

You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something. . . .

Something!

Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

You can see your nipples
through this shirt.

Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

The French call it an amuse-bouche.

Well, it is amusing.

Oh, hi, Wendy.

Yeah, 8:00.

What did we say, $ 1 0 an hour?

Okay, great.

All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

Ten dollars an hour for what?

I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

Waitressing?

Of course I thought of you.

But. . . .

But. . . .

But, but. . . .

But, you see, it's just this thing
has to go just perfect, you know. . .

. . .and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

You know, I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '7 6.

Amuse-bouche?

Talk to me.

A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning--

Talk dirty.

-Here?
-Come on.

Come on.

Say something. . .

. . .hot!

What?

What?

What?

What?

-What?
-Vulva.

''Vulva?''

All right, I panicked, all right?

She took me by surprise.

But it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, we ended up cuddling.

Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

Shut up. It was nice.

I just don't think I'm
the dirty-talking kind of guy.

Just say what you want to do to her.

Or what you want her to do to you.

Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

Please be kidding.

Why not? Come on.

Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

I'm in my apartment. . . .

Yeah, what else?

You're not there.
We're not having this conversation!

-All right. I'll start.
-Joey, please.

Come on, come on.
All right, ready?

Oh, Ross. . .

. . .you get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

See?

Now you say something.

I really don't think so.

Come on.

You like this woman?

-You wanna see her again?
-Sure.

If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

Now tell me you want
to caress my butt!

Okay, turn around.

I don't want you staring at me
while I do this.

All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

Okay.

I want--

Okay, I want. . .

. . .to feel. . .

. . .your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

There you go.

Keep going, keep going.

I want to take my tongue and--

Say it.

Say it!

--run it all over your body. . .

. . .until you're trembling with--

With?

-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

It's okay. It's okay.

I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

While you were sleeping, that guy
from your old job called again.

Again?

-And again and again and again.
-And again.

And again!

Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

Yeah, I miss you too.

It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

That's very generous.

But look, this isn't about the money.

I need something more than a job.
I need something I really care about--

That's on top of the year-end
bonus structure?

-Your dream!
-Your dream!

Look, Al. Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

Stop saying numbers!

I'm telling you, you've got
the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy!

I'll see you Monday!

Wow! It's huge!

It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

This is a cube!

Look at this.

You have a window!

Yes, indeedy.

-With a beautiful view of--
-Oh, look! That guy's peeing!

Okay. That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

Okay, sit down here. Sit down.

This is great. This is great.

You ready?

Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

Thank you, that'll be all.

Last time I do that.
I promise.

Wendy, we had a deal.

Yeah, you promised.

Who was that?

Wendy bailed.

I have no waitress.

That's too bad.

Bye-bye.

-Ten dollars an hour!
-Nope.

$ 1 2 an hour.

I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there for you.

I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you. . . .

Twenty dollars an hour.

Done.

Well, hello! Welcome to Monica's!
May I take your coat?

-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

Hello, greeter girl.

-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

Everything smells so delicious.

I can't remember a time I smelled
such a delicious combination of--

Okay, smells.

It's a lovely apartment.

Thank you. Would you like a tour?

I was just being polite,
but all right.

What's up?

In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

What?

Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

Okay, I'm with you, Cheech.

Is it dry in here?

Let me get you some wine.

I think we're ready
for our first course too.

These are rock shrimp ravioli. . .

. . .in a cilantro ponzu sauce. . .

. . .with just a touch of minced. . .

. . .ginger.

Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

These are fantastic!

Oh, gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

That's all there is of these. . .

. . .but in about 8 1 /2 minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

''Tartlets?''

''Tartlets. ''

''Tartlets. ''

Word has lost all meaning.

Excuse me. Can I help you
with anything?

You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

Oh, cool! Taco shells!

These are-- They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

You don't want to spoil your appetite.

Sugar-O's!

You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

No, we don't.

Sorry.

Why don't you just have a seat here?

Give me the Gummy Bears.

Give them to me.

We'll share.

-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

Give them to me!

This is not working.

Bears overboard! They're drowning!

Hey, fellas! Grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help!

That's it! Dinner is over!

-What?
-''What?''

-Why?
-''Why?''

I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this. . .

. . .and you can't even wait

What a tool.

You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

I know. It's just I just thought
that this was, you know, ''it. ''

You'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

You know those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

So how did it go with Celia?

I was unbelievable.

All right, Ross!

I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

I mean, there were characters,
plot lines. . .

. . .themes, a motif.

At one point, there were villagers.

And. . . .

Well, by the time we finished
with all the dirty talk. . .

. . .it was late and we were
both exhausted, so. . . .

-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

Whoa! Where the hell is he?

Yes, Fran, I know what time it is. . .

. . .but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

Oh, really?
Let me tell you something.

You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

How's this?

Sorry. How about over here?

That just means it's working.

Does this hurt?

How about this?

There you go!

Oh, the throb!



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
This is unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham about now.

There's the waitress.
Excuse me!

-Hello, miss?
-It's Phoebe!

Okay, will that be all?

Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

I was over there. . .

. . .then you said, ''Excuse me, miss. ''
So now I'm here.

How come you're working here?

Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

Can we start over?

Okay, great.
I'm gonna be over here.

I don't know if he's testing me
or just acting out. . .

. . .but my monkey is out of control!

He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

Supposedly by accident.

Yeah, I've done that.

And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did. . .

. . .and peed all over the crossword!

I've never done that.

Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

I'm saying I see a difference.

They're twins.

I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

You know that thing
when we talk about things?

Let's not do that anymore.

Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today?

Oh, fun!

-Liam Neeson.
-No.

Morley Safer.

The woman who cuts my hair!

This could be a really long game.

Your sister, Ursula.

Oh, really?

She works at that place. . . .

Riff's. Yeah, I know.

You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

So is she fat?

Not from where I was standing.

Where were you standing?

Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

She was the first to walk. . .

. . .even though I did it
later that same day.

To my parents, by then it was,
''Yeah, what else is new?''

I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

Is this just gonna be you and Carol?

Susan will be there too.

We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

Isn't that gonna be weird?

It might have been at first. . .

. . .but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

That's my jacket.

I know.

We're the Rostens.

I'm J.C. and he's Michael.

And we're having a boy and a girl.

Good for you!
Alrighty, next?

I'm Ross Geller.

And that's my boy in there.

And this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

Susan is Carol's. . . .

Who's next?

Sorry, Susan is. . .?

-Susan is Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

Like buddies.

Like lovers.

You know how close women can get.

-Susan and I live together.
-I was married to her.

-Carol, not me.
-It's a little complicated.

-But we're fine.
-Absolutely.

So, twins!

That's like two birds.

--to you too, Helen!

Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

Okay, send her in.

-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

I was just going over your data.

You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

Which is bad, because. . .?

It throws my WENUS out of whack.

Excuse me?

WENUS.

Weekly Estimated
Net Usage Statistics.

Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your. . .

. . .WENUS.

It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that. . .

. . .she's really, really cute.

It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

Ross.

Your little creature's
got the remote again.

Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

Marcel!

Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

You give Rossy the remote--

-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

Oh, cool.

Urkel. . .

. . .in Spanish is Urkel.

How did he do this?

Is leaving the Christmas lights up. . .

. . .your plan to keep us
merry all year long?

Someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's. . .

. . .but obviously someone forgot!

Someone was supposed to write:

''Rach, take down the lights''
and put it on the refrigera--

How long has that been there?

Where you been?

Riff's. I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.

She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

Score.

She is so hot!

Okay, before you do
anything Joey-like. . .

. . .you might want to run it by. . . .

Pheebs?

Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know. . .

. . .whatever.

And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

But, you know,
we've grown apart, so. . . .

I don't know. Why not?

Cool. Thanks.

You okay?

Yeah, I'm fine.

Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

Sorry.

Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

You can go.
I'll get the information.

No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

Oh, good.

This will be fun.

We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

Mommies, get on your back.

And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

-What?
-What?

I'm supposed to be the mommy?

Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

I have to miss out on the coaching
training because I'm a woman?

So what do you propose to do?

-I'll flip you for it.
-Flip me for it?

Heads, heads, heads!

On your back, Mom!

All right, Mommies, take
a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

Good.

Now imagine your vagina is opening. . .

. . .like a flower.

Mr. Dee! How's it going, sir?

It's been better.

The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

It's pretty ugly.

We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

What's it mean?

We'll be laying off people.

I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

Not you.

Relax.

Ever have to fire anyone?

Nina. . . .

Nina.

Are you okay?

Yes. Yes, I am.

Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was. . . .

Please don't hate me.

What?

Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

So, what do you want
for your birthday?

What I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

Bath salts would be nice!

Good.

What is this place?

You're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

How bad could it be?

I think we have an answer.

What's she doing here?

This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

-Think she got fired at Riff's?
-No, we were there last night.

She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go. . .?

I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

It looks like her.

Excuse me?

Hi, it's us!

Right. And it's me!

So you're here too?

As much as you are.

Your turn.

We know what we want.

That's good.

-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti cookies.

Good choice.

It's definitely her.

I can't believe you.

You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job?

You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

Congratulations! I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

Trying to find the right moment.

That shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

''Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?''

Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

I'll get it.

Hi, Mr. Heckles.

You're doing it again.

We're not doing anything.

We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

I can hear you through the ceiling.

My cats can't sleep.

You don't even have cats.

I could have cats.

Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

We'll try to keep it down.

Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

Try this on to make sure it fits.

My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really--

It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

Sure. Yeah.

Okay, it fits.

Are you seeing her again?

Yep, Ice Capades.

This is serious.

I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of ''capade. ''

I don't know. I like her.

She's different.
There's something about her--

That you like.
We get it. You like her.

Phoebe, I asked you
and you said it was okay.

Well, maybe now it's not okay.

Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

Knit, good woman.
Knit! Knit!

And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

Mr. Douglas.

Cool tie.

She's still here.

Yes. Yes, she is.

Didn't I memo you?

After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen. . .

. . .Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

In fact, he mentioned
the word ''frenzy. ''

She seems so. . . .

Oh, no, no.
Nina? She's. . . .

In fact, if you asked her now. . .

. . .she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

That's unbelievable.

And yet believable.

So I decided not to fire her again. . .

. . .until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

I see. You never really know what's
going on inside a person's head.

Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

Lights, please.

And that's having a baby.

Next week is our final class.

Susan, go deep.

It's impossible.
It's just impossible.

What is, honey?

What that woman. . .

. . .did.

I am not doing that!

It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

-It'll just stay in.
-Carol, honey.

-Everything will be all right.
-What do you know?

No one's saying to you,
''Hi, is that your nostril?

Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?! ''

Carol, sweetie.

Cleansing breath.

I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

The birth part is just one day. . .

. . .and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

Ross?

Ross.

I'm gonna be a father.

-This is just occurring to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

I just never realized
the baby was having me.

You're gonna be great.

How could you say that?

I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

How will I raise a kid?

You know, some scientists
are now saying. . .

. . .that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

-Where are you going?
-Out.

With. . .?

Can I just ask you one question?

Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

You know?

Yet?

Not that it's any
of your business. . .

. . .but no, we haven't.

You meant sex, right?

-Do you have a sec?
-Sure, Nina. What's up?

For the past few days,
people have been avoiding me. . .

. . .and giving me strange looks.

Oh, well, maybe that's because. . .

. . .they're jealous of us.

Maybe.

But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

Well, maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

Oh, my God!
You're amazing!

Oh, you don't know.

Helen, make sure we do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

You still want me to send her
psychological profile to personnel?

Helen drinks.

Will you marry me?

-I ended up telling her everything.
-How'd she take it?

Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation. . .

. . .never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

Okay, I think I get how to do this.

Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

Because I can't watch.

They're gone.

Are you all right?

Yeah. It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

Okay, can I ask. . .?

So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

Yeah.

I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson thermos. . .

. . .so she threw it under the bus.

And then there's Randy Brown. . .

. . .who was like. . . .

Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

Well, but that's what he was for me.

And she, you know,
kind of stole him away. . .

. . .and then broke his heart.

And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my thermos. . .

. . .or anything, but. . . .

-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

Yeah, okay.

He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt. . . .

He's falling in love with her.

They've been going out a week.

They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

May we help you?

What are you doing? It's freezing!
Would you come inside?

No, no, no.

You wanted me to take them down. . .

. . .so I'm taking them down, okay?

Rachel!

I'm okay. I'm okay.

Mr. Heckles?

Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.

It's this whole stupid Ursula thing.

Okay, insurance?

Yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!

You don't have insurance?

Why? How much will this cost?

X-rays alone could be
a couple hundred dollars!

-What'll we do?
-There's not much we can do.

Unless I use yours.

Now wait a second.

Who did I just put as my
''in case of emergency'' person?

That's insurance fraud.

All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.

-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

Why?

I am really an idiot!

I was filling out my friend's form. . .

. . .and instead of putting
her information. . .

. . .I put mine.

You are an idiot.

Yep, that's me.
I am that stupid.

I had a dream that I was
playing football with my kid.

That's nice.

No, no. With him.

I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

I've gotta do something because the
Tampa Bay team's coming right at me!

Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.

Right, but. . .

. . .it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

And so, I. . .

. . .I just heave it downfield!

What are you, crazy?
That's a baby!

He should take the sack?

Anyway. . .

. . .suddenly I'm downfield.

And I realize that I'm the one
who's suppose to catch him, right?

Only I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.

So I am running and I'm running. . .

. . .and that is when I woke up.

See, I am so not ready
to be a father.

Hey, you're gonna be fine.

You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

You're gonna make a great dad.

Yeah, Ross. You and the baby
just need better blocking.

Have you ever been to the
Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

Only if you order stuff.

I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

Tonight.

Man, what are the odds
of that happening?

You take your time.

There it is!

What'll you do?

What can I do? I don't want
to screw it up with Ursula.

And your friend, Phoebe?

If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you guys?

If you tried that on my birthday. . .

. . .you'd be staring at
the business end of a hissy fit.

An added pinch of saffron
makes all the difference.

Monica?

Yes?

Yes, she is.

This is my friend, Rachel.

Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.

And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen.

Aren't you a little cute
to be a doctor?

Excuse me?

God, young, young.
I meant young.

Young to be a doctor.

-Good, Rach.
-Thank you.

He said it was a sprain,
and that was it.

You left out the stupid part.

It's not stupid.

The very cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow night, and I said yes.

I think it's totally insane.
They work for the hospital.

It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? Monica, they are cute.

They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

All right, what have
we learned so far?

Oh, God.

Surprise!

What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!

-Was that the cake?
-Yeah.

I got a lemon schmush.

Come on.
She'll be here any minute.

I hope it's okay.

''Happy Birthday, Peehee. ''

Maybe we can make
a ''B'' out of a rose.

Yeah, we'll just use
our special cake tools.

-What's going on?
-We just--

Surprise!

This is so great!

This was not at all scary.

Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty!

Betty, hi!

You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.

Everybody I love is in the same room.

Where's Joey?

Did you see Betty?

I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.

Years ago, if somebody'd said, ''Here's
a tomato that looks like a prune'' . . .

. . .I'd have said,
''Get out of my office! ''

Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out at all?

I'm not freaking out!
I'm just saying. . .

. . .if someone had come to me
with the idea--

I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.

Did you ever get this sort of. . .

. . .panicky, ''Oh, my God, I'm gonna
be a father'' kind of a thing?

Your mother did the work.
I was busy with the business.

I wasn't around that much.

Is that what this is about?

No, no. I was just wondering.

There's time to make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

You always wanted to go to coIonial
Williamsburg. How about we do that?

Thanks, Dad, really.

You know, I just, I just. . . .

I just needed to know. . .

. . .when did you start
to feel like a father?

Well, I guess it must have been
the day after you were born.

We were in the hospital room,
your mother was asleep. . .

. . .and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

You were this ugly little red thing!

And all of a sudden, you grabbed
my finger with your whole fist. . .

. . .and you squeezed it. . .

. . .so tight.

And that's when I knew.

So you don't want to go
to Williamsburg?

We can go to Williamsburg.

Eat your fish.

Rachel, the cute doctors are here!

Okay, coming.

Hi, come on in.
Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.

We brought wine.

Look at this. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

-How could we resist?
-That's great!

-So, Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's. . . .

Why don't you tell them?

After all, it is your ankle.

It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses.

Stat!

Listen, why don't we just
tell them who we really are?

-I think it'll be fine.
-It will not. We'll get in trouble.

Would you stop being such a wuss!

A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

-So?
-So they still seem normal.

Because they are.

When we go out with women
we meet at the hospital--

Would you relax?
Take a look around.

There are no pagan altars.

No piles of bones in the corners.

They're fine. Go like this:

We are not going to do it, okay?
Sometimes you can be such a big baby!

-I am not a baby.
-Be serious.

-You get uptight--
-You act like a princess.

You know what? You know what?

Every day you are becoming
more and more like your mother.

Excuse me.

Here we go.

This is a great place.
How long have you lived here?

Thanks. I've been here
about six years.

And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

See, I was supposed to get married. . .

. . .but I left the guy at the altar.

Yeah, I know
it's pretty selfish, but. . .

. . .hey, that's me!

Why don't you try the hummus?

Monica, what do you do?

I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

Good for you.

Yeah, it is.

Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

Well, this hummus is great.

God bless the chickpea.

Oh, God!

I am so spoiled!

That's it.

And have I mentioned that
back in high school. . .

. . .I was a cow?

I used to wet my bed.

I use my breasts to get
other people's attention.

We both do that!

Monica and Rachel's apartment.

Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.

Hi, Dad.

No, no. It's me.

Listen, Dad,
I can't talk right now.

But there's something. . . .

There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

Excuse me.

Remember back in freshman year?

Well, Billy Dreskin and I
had sex on your bed.

Daddy. . . .

Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?

His father tried to put
you out of business!

You are dead!

Ross, he's got the remote again.

Good.

Maybe he can switch it back.

Maybe not.

Hold on a second and let me
just check and see if she's here.

It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem with the form.

Oh, God, what do we do?

Just find out what they want.

Okay. No, you do it.

Hello. This is Monica.

Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.

-You're right, this wasn't worth it.
-Thank you.

Let me just change.

Trouble?

Your sister stood me up
the other night.

Oh, no. Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

-Did you try calling her?
-I've been trying for two days.

When I called the restaurant,
they said she was busy.

I can't believe
she's blowing me off!

You got a minute?

Yeah, I'm just working.

I got you a birthday present.

Wow, you remembered!

It's a Judy Jetson thermos.

Like the kind you--

Right.

Oh, I got something for you too.

How'd you know I was coming?

Yeah, twin thing.

I can't believe you did this.

I can't believe you. . .

. . .did this!

So what's the deal
with you and Joey?

Oh, right.

He is so great.
But that's over.

-Does he know?
-Who?

Joey. You know, he's really nutsy
about you.

He is? Why?

You got me.

Excuse me. . .

. . .doesn't this come
with a side salad?

So are you gonna call him?

-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

No, no. He is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

Do you want some chicken?

No, no.
No food with a face, remember?

You have not changed.

Yeah, you too.

Hi! Remember us?

You just called about needing
a signature on the admissions form?

Well, it turns out
we need a whole new one.

Because, you see. . .

. . .I put the wrong name again.

-Because--
-You're that stupid!

I am. I'm that stupid!

And I'm just gonna pay
for this with a check.

Your insurance will cover that.

Yeah, I know.
I'm just not that bright either.

Okay, worst case scenario:

Say you never feel like a father.

Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

Do you have a point?

You know, you'd think I would.

What's up with the simian?

It's just a fur ball.

Whose turn is it?

Yours. I got

No, you got
zero points for ''idney. ''

I had a ''K. ''
Where's my ''K''?

You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a ''K'' !

Get that animal out of here!

The animal hospital is across town.
He's choking!

-What is it?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

Excuse me.

This hospital is for people!

He is people!
He has a name, okay?

He watches Jeopardy!...

. . .he touches himself
when nobody's watching.

Please have a heart.

-I'll take a look at him.
-Thank you.

-Michael!
-Rachel.

-What?
-Monica.

Urs!

I've been trying to call you.

Listen. . . .

Don't say ''listen. '' I know that
''listen. '' I've said that ''listen. ''

I'm sorry.

I don't get it.
What happened?

What about what
you said under the bridge?

Forget about what
I said under the bridge.

I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

You don't drink.

That's right, I don't.

But I was drunk on you.

But it's not gonna work.

Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

If it was, would you
stop hanging out with her?

No, I couldn't do that.

Then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

So you know, it's either her or me.

Then I'm sorry.

You're gonna be
really hard to get over.

I know.

I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what. . .

. . .but you've never
looked so beautiful.

Really?

Pheebs?

He looks so tiny.

-We just got the message.
-Is he okay?

The doctor got the ''K'' out.

He also found an ''M'' and an ''O. ''

We think he was trying
to spell out ''monkey. ''

The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

So you feel like a dad yet?

No. Why?

Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

That's very ''dad. ''

He's waking up.

Hey, fella.
How you doing?



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Rach, we're running low on rsums.

Do you want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

If you must work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.

I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.

I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me. ''

Rach, did you proofread these?

Why?

Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills!

Oh, my God!

Do you think it's on all of them?

No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few!

The One With the Poker

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Hey, guys.

Hi, ladies.

Can I get you anything?

-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.

Really? Sure we have scones left!

Read them to me.

''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you
for your inquiry. However. . . . ''

-We have apple cinnamon--
-''Dear Miss Greene'' . . . .

Your VISA bill is huge!

Give me that.

I can't believe you.
Linda's great.

-Why won't you date her?
-I don't know.

Is this still about her. . .

. . . ''The Flintstones could
have really happened'' thing?

It's not just that.

It's just, I want someone
who does something for me. . .

. . .who gets my heart pounding. . .

. . .who makes me. . . .

Little play things with yarn?

What?

Could you want her more?

Who?

Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!

Who?

Look, I am totally, totally over her.

-I just--
-Coffee?

No, we're fine.
We're fine.

Shut up!

We're not saying anything.

What?

Joey cried last night.

Thank you.

We were playing poker.

There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.

God, you should've seen him.
''Read them and weep! ''

And then he did.

Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

What is that? Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

Like it's poker,
so only guys can play?

Women are welcome to play.

Then what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know. . . .

All right, what is it?

There just aren't
any women in our game.

We just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

Please! That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

Do you know how to play?

No.

But you could teach us.

No.

Okay, so now we draw cards.

I wouldn't need any,
because I have a straight.

-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

Pheebs, how many do you want?

I just need two. The 1 0 of spades
and the 6 of clubs.

Pheebs, you can't do that.

I've got the 1 0 of spades. Here.

Thanks.

See, you can't do that.

I don't need them.
I'm going for 4s.

Oh, you're. . . .

Here we go.

We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudits.

What are you doing?

This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.

It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz--

At this point, the dealer--

We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes! Big bucks!

You sure? Phoebe
just threw away two jacks. . .

. . .because they didn't look happy.

But I'm ready. So just deal.

Everybody, last minute
lesson! Joey. . . .

Three. . .

. . .eight!

Eight, three. All right!

Damn it, damn it, damn it!

I see. So then you were lying.

-About what?
-About how good your cards were.

I was bluffing.

And what is ''bluffing''?

Is it not another word for lying?

Sorry to break up this party. . .

. . .but I've got rsums to fax
before work tomorrow.

Rach, we've got to settle.

Settle what?

The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

You see, King George
is giving us the land, so. . . .

The game, Rachel.
You owe us money for the game.

Oh, right!

Guys, it's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

Hell, no! We'll pay.

Okay, Monica, I had
another answer all ready.

And you know what?

-We want a rematch.
-That's fine with me.

Could use the money.

So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

And I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win.

In order for me to win,
others have to lose.

If you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be nice.

Because once those cards
are dealt. . . .

I'm not a nice guy.

All right, boys. Let's eat.

Did you get that from
the ''I Love Rachel'' pizzeria?

Are you still on that?

Come on. What was with that
Black Bart speech?

''When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy'' !

You're way off, pal.

I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her!

I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

I just-- Marcel!

Where are you going
with that disk?

You are not putting that on again.

If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

Yeah, I know.

He can get really competitive.

What?

''Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! ''

Please!

I am not as bad as Ross.

I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

That was not an incident.

I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

Saks Fifth Avenue!

It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

What's the job?

Assistant buyer!

I would be shopping. . .

. . .for a living!

That's Aunt Iris. This woman's been
playing poker since she was 5.

You've got to listen
to every word she says.

-Is Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.

-My God! Really?
-No, that's bluffing! Lesson one!

Let me tell you something.

Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap!

-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

Girls, sit down!

Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and that's Rachel--

Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

All right.

I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

Guys, guess what, guess what?

The fifth dentist caved, and now
they all recommend Trident?

No, the interview!

She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.

We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

And I went to camp with her cousin.

And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!

That's great!

God! And she told
the funniest story.

Great, you'll tell us
and we'll laugh!

Let's play poker!

Listen, we talked about it. . .

. . .and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

We can play some other game. Like. . .

. . .Pictionary?

Very funny.

We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

Yes, I think we should.

Rach, do you want me
to shuffle those?

That's okay,
I'm gonna give it a go.

So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.

And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

Thanks for teaching us ''Crossed-eyed
Mary. '' We gotta play that other way.

Here's my 7.50, but you should
know that this money is cursed.

-What?
-I cursed it!

So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

So that just leaves the big
Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.

It's so typical:

''I'm a man! I have a penis!

I have to win money
to exert my power over women! ''

You know, this isn't over.

We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

And you will beg and we will laugh.

And we will take
every last dime you have.

And you will
hate yourselves forever!

Kind of stepped on
my point there, Monica!

Wanna hand over your money now?

That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of playing.

No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh, monkey boy.

Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?

You guys, look! The one-eyed Jack
follows me wherever I go.

Right, okay. Serious poker.

Excuse me.
Where are you going?

To the bathroom.

Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or play poker?

I wanna go to the bathroom.

Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

I'm waiting to hear from that job. The
store closes at 9. You can eat then.

That's fine. I'll just have
a Tic Tac to hold me over.

Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

Yes!

Or no!

Your money's mine, Greene.

Your fly's open, Geller.

You know what I just realized?

''Joker'' is ''poker'' with a ''J'' !

Coincidence?

That's ''joincidence'' with a ''C'' !

Yeah, I'm out.

I'm in.

Me too.

Me too.
What do you got?

You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

Well, well, well!

Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four 6s!

I got four 6s!
I won! I actually won!

Oh, my God!

You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .

Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

And your fly's still open

I made you look

-I'm in.
-I couldn't be inner.

Monica, in or out?

I hate this game!

Okay, Joey, your bet.

I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach. . .

. . .by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

I'm out.

I'm very in.

Couldn't be more out.

Me too.

I will see you and I'll raise you.

Do you wanna waste another buck?

No, not this time.

-What did you have?
-I'm not telling.

Come on, show them.

-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

Your whole face is getting red.

Little veins popping out
of your temple.

Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

-I'm not losing. Just deal the--
-You are definitely losing.

Rachel Greene.

Excuse me.

It's about the job!

Barbara, hi! How are you?

No, I understand.

Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

But, you know, if anything else
opens up, please--

Sorry, Rach.

You know, there's gonna be
lots of other stuff.

Where were we?

Five card draw. Jacks are better.

Nothing wild, everybody ante.

Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.

Yes, we do.

-All right. Check.
-Check.

I'm in for 50 cents.

-Call.
-I'm in.

I see your 50 cents. . .

. . .and I raise you. . .

. . . $5.

I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet $5.

Does anybody
have a problem with that?

-Not at all.
-No, no.

Loser?

No, I fold.

What do you mean, you ''fold''?
What is this?

I thought that, ''Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! ''

Were you just full of it?

I'm in.

-How many do you want?
-One.

Dealer takes two.

-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

See your 2. . .

. . .and I raise you. . .

. . .20.

I see your 20. . .

. . .raise you 25.

See your 25. . .

. . .and, Monica, get my purse.

There's nothing in it.

Okay, then get me your purse.

Here you go. Good luck!

Thank you.

I saw your 25 and I raise you. . .

. . .seven.

--teen!

Joey, I'm a little shy.

That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

-What do you need?
-Fifteen.

-Here's 1 0.
-I got 5.

-Thank you.
-Good luck.

I am calling your 1 7.

What do you got?

Full house!

You got me.

-That's a tough hand to beat.
-I thought we had them!

When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

But look how happy she is.

-Airmail.
-Airplane.

Airport.
Airport '7 5!

Airport '7 7! Airport '79!

Time's up.

Bye Bye Birdie!

That's a bird?

That's a bird!

Okay, it's my turn.

Go!

The One Where the Monkey Gets Away

English Subtitles by

Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

Thank you.

Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

Oh, good, because
where else would we get any?

Oh, right.

Great.

What is it?

Country club newsletter.

My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
It's Barry and Mindy!

-Barry, who you almost--?
-Barry, who I almost--

-And Mindy, your maid of--
-Mindy, my maid of--

Let me see.
That's Mindy?

Wow! She is pretty.

Lucky. . .

. . .to have had a friend like you.

Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on, bring me the rice.

Good boy.
Give me the rice.

Thank you. Good boy.

He's mastered the difference
between ''bring me the'' . . .

. . .and ''pee in the. ''

''Bring me the'' and--
Rach?

Oh, I'm sorry.

This is so stupid!

I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

I should be happy for them.

I am. I'm happy for them.

Really?

I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

Whoa, what. . . .

What happened to
''Forget relationships!

I'm done with men''?
The whole penis embargo?

I don't know.

I guess it's not about ''no guys. ''

It's about the ''right guy,''
you know?

With Barry. . .

. . .it was safe and it was easy,
but there was no heat.

With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

And I mean, it was just
this raw, animal, sexual--

Right, right! I got it.

I was there.

But do you think
you can ever have both?

Someone that's your best friend. . .

. . .but then also can make
your toes curl.

Yes, I do. I really do.

In fact, it's funny.

Often, someone who
you wouldn't think could. . .

. . .curl your toes. . .

. . .might just be the one who--

--gets interrupted.

Hey, guys, how was the movie?

-Wonderful!
-It was so good!

-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with, like, guns and bombs. . .

. . .and buses going really fast!

I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie. . .

. . .as long as
there's a little nudity.

There was nudity.

I meant female nudity.

I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

Hugh! Hugh Grant!

All right, I've got to go.

Come on, Marcel.
Come on!

We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

They're still just friends, right?

And I will see you tomorrow.

Right. You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

Hang on. Does Aunt Monica
get a say in this?

Please, Aunt Monica, please?

Oh, unclench.
You won't even be here.

I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.

If it was gonna happen
with Rachel. . .

. . .wouldn't it
have happened already?

She said she's looking
for a relationship. . .

. . .with someone exactly like me.

She said that?

Well, I added
the ''exactly like me'' part.

But she said
she's looking for someone.

And someone will be there tonight.

''Tonight'' tonight?

It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine. . .

. . .go over there
and try to woo her.

You know what you should do?

Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

If you keep this up...

... you'll be finished
by the weekend.

Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

Now, she used to be a man.

Look. See, there's Raven.

We hate her.

We're glad she's dying.

And then--
What? Marcel!

Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--

Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

Oh, God!

Sorry, Barry.

A little engagement gift.

I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

Who died? Who died?

Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because--

Marcel?

-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

We were watching TV,
then he pooped in Monica's shoe. . . .

Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

I don't know.

The left one!

Which ones?

Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

Why is the air in here so negative?

Rachel lost Marcel.

Oh, no! How?

-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

Those cute black ones
I wear all the time.

No, which one?

The right or left?

Because the left one is lucky.

Come on!
What am I gonna do?

All right.
You're a monkey. . .

. . .you're loose in the city.

Where do you go?

It's his first time out, so he'll
do some of the touristy things.

I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

He'll be home any minute.
He'll kill me!

Search the building.
You take the first and second floor.

We'll take third and fourth.

What am I gonna do?

You stay here
and just wait by the phone.

Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

Does anybody want to trade?

What do you want?

Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
Have you seen it?

I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

Why'd you leave it in the hall?

I wasn't ready for it.

The monkey, have you seen a monkey?

I saw Regis Philbin once.

Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

You owe me a waffle.

He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face. . .

. . .with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

Thanks.

How did it go today?

Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

Is that wine?

You want some?

Oh, I would love some.

But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.

I feel crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

We could. But before we go to
the murder capital of the Northeast. . .

. . .I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

You know how we
were talking before. . .

. . .about relationships and stuff. . . .

-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

Oh, God!

Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

Please don't hate me.

What? What?

You know Marcel?

I kind of lost him.

I can't believe this.

All I asked you to do was
keep him in the apartment!

I know. I'm sorry.

I guess it's partially my fault.

I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

I should have started you off
with a pencil.

I'm doing everything I can.

I've got everybody looking
for him and I got--

-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

Why? Do you not like them?

Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

I'm not allowed to have him.

If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

Hi! Thanks for coming.

Somebody called about a monkey?

You know what? That was
a complete misunderstanding.

We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

-It turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

We checked the third floor.
No one's seen Marcel.

My uncle Marcel.

Is that who the monkey's named after?

Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable. . .

. . .by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

Oh, my God!

You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

Yes, but there isn't always time.

I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

We haven't been introduced.
I'm Monica Geller.

Oh, my God, you are!

And you're Rachel Greene!

Luisa Gianetti!
Lincoln High?

I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

Luisa! Oh, my God!

Monica! It's Luisa!

Luisa! From homeroom!

You have no idea who I am, do you?

Not at all.

Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

Would it have been so hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa'' . . .

. . .or ''Nice overalls''?

Oh, I'm so sorry!

It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

But you. What a bitch!

What?

You know what?
Be that as it may.

Could you help us out here on that
monkey thing for old times' sake?

Go, Bobcats!

I could. But I won't.

If I find that monkey, he's mine.

Sorry.

Marcel?

Marcel?

Hi, can I help you?

We're kind of having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

No, I haven't seen a monkey.

Can you fix radiators?

Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

Of course!

Oh. Then, no.

Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum?

Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

Oh, no, wait!

We may not know
about radiators, per se. . .

. . .but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

Weren't we in the middle
of something?

But these women are very hot
and they need our help.

And they're very hot!

We can't, all right?

We're sorry.

You have no idea how sorry.
But we promised to find this monkey.

He's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

-Oh, my God!
-What?!

Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

Look, Phoebe!

Oh, Marcel! Come here!

Step aside, ladies.

-What are you gonna do?
-Just a small tranquilizer.

Run, Marcel! Run, Marcel!

Damn!

Are you okay?

I think so.

Oh, gosh!

We've been all
over the neighborhood!

He's gone!
He's just gone!

-You don't know that.
-Come on! It's cold, it's dark.

He doesn't know the Village!

And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my--

I have no monkey and a broken foot.

Thank you very much!

I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

What do you want me to do?

You want me to break my foot too?

Here, I'll break my foot right now.

Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

Yeah, now that you kicked the sign. . .

. . .I don't miss Marcel anymore!

It's not like
I did this on purpose.

No, this is just vintage Rachel.

Things just sort of happen around you!

You're off in ''Rachel Land,''
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' . . .

. . .oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and--

I don't even want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

What? What?

Hey, banana man!

Oh, this is so intense!

One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

Hi! Did you order some bananas?

-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

I don't have a monkey.

-Then what's with all the bananas?
-Potassium.

Okay, where is he?
Where is he?

What have you done to him?

That's my monkey.
That's Patty the monkey.

Are you insane?

Come here, Marcel.

Come here, Patty.

Come here, Marcel.

Come here, Patty.

Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

Gotcha!

-Give me my monkey back!
-That's my monkey.

Take this up with the judge.

That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

You can send it back whenever.

All right, I want my monkey!

Oh, come on, Luisa.

Sorry, prom queen.

You had to be a bitch in school,
you couldn't have been fat.

In high school,
I was the prom queen. . .

. . .and the homecoming queen
and the class president and you. . .

. . .were also there.

If you take this monkey, I'll lose. . .

. . .one of the most
important people in my life.

You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

Take it!

Then I'll call your supervisor
and tell her. . .

. . .you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart!

It'll be nice
to get this off, won't it?

Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

With the right pair of pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

Listen. . . .

I'm sorry I was
so hard on you before--

No, come on. It was my fault.
I almost lost your--

But you got him back.
You were great.

We still have that bottle of wine.

Are you in the mood for. . .

. . .something grape?

-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

The neighbors must be vacuuming.

Well, as long as we're. . .

. . .here. . .

. . .and not on the subject. . . .

I was thinking about. . .

. . .how mad we got
at each other before.

And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we--

-Rachel?
-Barry?

I can't. I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

I'm still in love with you.

We have got to start
locking that door!

This is me in The Sound of Music.
You see the von Trapp kids?

Because I'm in front of them.

I thought that was an alp.

High school was not
my favorite time.

I don't know.
I loved high school.

It was just like four years
of parties and dating and sex and--

Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

My butt cheek is waking up!



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

No way!
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

They're crazy!

Oh, my God! You gotta come see this.

There's some creep out there
with a telescope!

I can't believe it!
He's looking right at us!

Oh, that is so sick!

I feel violated.

And not in a good way.

How can people do that?

You guys, look!

English Subtitles by

I tell you, years from now,
school children will study it. . .

. . .as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

It was unbelievable.

We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

Have you called her?

Let her know I like her?
Are you insane?

Guys! It's gross!

It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

I'm right. Right?

Yeah, let her dangle.

I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me. . .

. . .to find one of you people.

God!
Come on. Just do it.

Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

-I got her machine.
-Her answering machine?

No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

So why didn't you say anything?

No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message. . .

. . .I ended up using the phrase,
''Yes, indeed-io! ''

Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look at once.

Okay! What's going on?

They're just talking.

Does he look upset?

Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

No. Actually, he's smiling.

Oh, my God! Don't do that!

What? What? What?

That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

See?

Hey, Rach.

How'd it go?

You know, it was actually
really great.

Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

Not a good day for birds.

Then we took a walk to Bendel's.

And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

That's nice.

Now was that before or after
you told him. . .

. . .to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

Right.

Well, we never actually got to that.

It was just so nice to see him again,
you know?

It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

It was just nice.

That's nice twice.

What's going on?

Isn't this the same Barry who
you left at the altar?

Where have you been?

But it was different
with him today.

He wasn't, like,
Orthodontist Guy, you know?

I mean, we had fun!
Is there anything wrong with that?

Why?

I have my reasons.

How about the fact that he's
engaged to another woman. . .

. . .who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

All right, all right!
I know it's stupid.

I'll go see him this afternoon
and I'll put an end to it.

I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

No, it wasn't!

It was so nice
having this little sink here.

''Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

Give me a call
when you get a chance. ''

Bye-bye.

Oh, God!

That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

I've been honing.

What was with the dishes?

I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant. . .

. . .you know, I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here. . .

. . .honing for the last two hours?

The guy with the telescope
is doing it again!

Oh, my God!

Go away!
Stop looking in here!

Great.
Now he's waving back.

We gotta do something about him.

I caught him looking
into our apartment.

It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff.

What kind of stuff?

Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff. . .

. . .but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

You cook naked?

Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

What's the matter?

I just--
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

No, it was.
It was very, very good.

What about Mindy?

Oh, way better than Mindy.

Not that! I mean,
what about you and Mindy?

Oh. If you want, I'll just
break it off with her.

No, don't do that.
Not for me.

Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

Thanks, Bernice.

Let's go away this weekend.

Come on.
This is all way too--

No, we can go to Aruba.

When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon. . .

. . .it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

I had a bra.

Hey, Dr. Farber.

All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

We're starting to see
some real progress here.

What?

I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

Can I use your phone?

For future reference,
that thing in your hand. . .

. . .can also be used as a phone.

Yes, it's working.

Why isn't she calling back?

Maybe she never got your message.

You could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps. . .

. . .that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

Doesn't that make me seem--?

Desperate? Needy?
Pathetic?

You obviously saw my personal ad.

How many beeps?

She answered.

This is where you'd use
that ''hello'' word we talked about.

I won't talk to her.
She obviously got my message. . .

. . .and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

God, I miss just being needy!

So how'd he take it?

Pretty well, actually.

How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

Oh, do I?

We ended up having sex in his chair.

You had sex in his chair?

I said that a little
too loudly, didn't I?

You had what?

Sex in his chair.

What. . . .

What were you thinking?

I don't know.
We still care about each other.

There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

It's nothing like me and Carol.

Please! If she said to you,
''Ross, I want you on this couch. . .

. . .right here, right now,''
what would you say?

If it helps I could slide over.

It's a totally different situation.

It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians--

I gotta go.

-Where are you going?
-I just have to go!

Do I need a reason?
I have things to do with my life.

I have a jam-packed schedule.

And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

Mindy.

How are you?

Yes, I heard. Congratulations!
That is so great!

Really, oh, God--

I'm working tomorrow. . .

. . .but if you want, you can come by
if you'd like.

Great!

So I'll see you tomorrow.

Bye.

Oh, God! Oh, God!

So how's Mindy?

She wants to see me tomorrow.

She sounded weird.
I gotta call Barry.

It's me. I just--

Mindy!

Mindy!

No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

Hell is filled
with people like you.

He's back.
The peeper's back.

-Get down!
-Get down?

And boogie.

Thanks, but I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

Relax. She may not even know.

I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

I mean, what else is it about?

She was my best friend, you guys.

We went to camp together. . .

. . .she taught me how to kiss. . . .

Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman!

I feel so--

Naughty!

-I'll see you guys later.
-I'll walk out with you.

When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp. . .

. . .and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or--?

That's fine, yeah.

I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

Why not take it with you?

We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

Why don't you just call her?

I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

-Do you?
-No!

Danielle, hi!

It's Chandler.

I'm fine.

Listen. . . .

I don't know if you tried to call me
because, idiot that I am. . .

. . .I accidentally shut off my phone.

That's fine. That's great. Okay.

She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back!

-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

Mindy.

Hey, you.

Hey, you.

So what's up?

We should really be sitting for this.

Sure we should.

So. . . .

Now, I know things have
been weird lately.

But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer. . .

. . .who I don't talk to anymore. . .

. . .because she's bitter
that she lost the weight. . .

. . .and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

I'll just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

Will you be my maid of honor?

Of course!

That's so great!

It is! It is!

-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all!

What?

That's not all.

Oh, sure it is!

Oh, no, it isn't!

I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

What would make you think that?

Ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel!

Really?

If it'll make you feel any better. . .

. . .when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

Oh, God!
That's what I was afraid of.

What's what you were afraid of?

When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I. . .

. . .kind of had
a little thing on the side.

What?

I know, I know.

When he proposed to me,
everyone said, ''Don't do it.

He'll do to you
what he did to Rachel. ''

And now I feel so stupid.

You are so stupid.

We are both so stupid.

What do you mean?

Smell familiar?

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

Oh, my!

Four letters, ''circle or hoop. ''

Ring, damn it, ring!

Thanks.

You know our phone's not working?

What?

I called from the coffee shop.

-There was no answer.
-I turned it off.

Mother of God, I turned it off!

Just like you told her you did.

Just pointing out the irony.

I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

Can I use your phone?

The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

''Heating device. ''

Radiator.

Five letters.

''Rdtor. ''

Yeah, is Sidney there?

Oh, this is?

Sidney's a woman.

So she's a woman, so what?

Yeah, so what?

I live across the street, and I know
all about you and your telescope.

And I don't appreciate it, okay?

Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

If I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear. . .

. . .I shouldn't have to feel--

Thank you.

That's not really the point.

The point is, that--

Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally--

Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

The green dress?

Really?

She said you looked like
Ingrid Bergman.

-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

Come on. . .

. . .in.

Hello, sweetheart.

What you guys doing here?

We are here to break up with you.

Both of you?

We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry!

I'm an idiot! I was weak!
I couldn't help myself.

Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

Which one of us
are you talking to there?

Mindy.

Of course, Mindy!
It was always Mindy.

Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

Oh, please!

During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup!

You did it twice?

The first time didn't count.
You know, it was Barry.

Oh, right.

Honey, baby, sweetheart, look. . . .

Just give me another chance.

We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

What do you say?

Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

Jason Castalano's choking
on his retainer.

Oh, God!
I'll be right there, Bernice.

Look, please don't go anywhere.

I'll be right back.

Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you!

See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

If I'm hogging the ball too much,
you jump right in there. . .

. . .and take a couple of punches.
This feels great!

I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

What are you talking about?

Mindy, the guy is the devil!

He is Satan in a smock!

Look, I know he's not perfect.

But the truth is
at the end of the day. . .

. . .I still really wanna be. . .

. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber. . .

. . .D.D.S.

Oh, God!

I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

You okay?

Really?

Ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding. . .

. . .I have wondered whether I made
the right choice.

And now I know.

I'm so glad.

Big day.

All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat. . . .

Did you know he's gay?

I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

Danielle, hi!

Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

Why are you here?

I've been calling you, but it
turns out I had your number wrong.

And when I finally got the right one,
there was no answer.

So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

I'm okay.

Listen, maybe we
could get together later?

That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

You got it!

Bye, everybody.

There you go.

Second date!

I don't know.

You don't know?

She seems nice, but that thing about
her coming all the way here. . .

. . .just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

Calm down. You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

When somebody steals
your credit card. . .

. . .they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

That's me.

He's doing it again!

Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

Come here, Marcel!

Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'II get him.

You've got to do something
about the humping.

What? It's just a phase.

Well, that's what we said about Joey.

Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

Marcel, stop it! Marcel!
Bad monkey!

What?

Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

The One With the Fake Monica

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

-This woman's living my life.
-What?

She's Living my Life,
and she's doing it better than me.

Look at this. Look.

She buys tickets to plays
I want to see.

She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

She spent $300 on art supplies.

You're not an artist.

Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

Oh, really?
Let's compare, shall we?

Oh, it's so late for ''shall we. ''

Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

Do I take classes at The New School?

This is so unfair.

She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

How about Joey Paponi?

No, still too ethnic.

My agent thinks I should have
a name that's more neutral.

Joey Switzerland?

Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm. . .

. . .this big.

Which I'm not!

Joe, Joe, Joe. . . .
Stalin?

Stalin.

Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

Joe Stalin.

You know, that's pretty good.

You might want to try Joseph.

Joseph Stalin!

-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

Joseph Stalin is
The Fiddler on the Roof!.

Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

What are you doing?

AII right, great.

Great. Thanks a lot.

I'm going to tap class.

So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

She's got my Life.
I want to see who she is.

Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

Honey, you're kind of losing it here.

This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

This is madness, I tell you.

For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it!

Thank you.

What do you think?

Lots of things.

Which one do you think she is?

-May I help you?
-No, thanks.

We're just here to observe.

You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

Spare shoes are over there.

What does she mean?

I think she means, ''You dance. . .

. . .a dance class! ''

Come on, come on, come on!

Really?

Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

People, last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

Let's not have that happen again!

She could be you.

Let's get started.

Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

Okay, I'm not getting this!

I'm totally getting it!

Do you ever just feel Like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

What? You just click
when they click.

AII right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

AII right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with Rachel.

Great, it's gym class all over again.

That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

It's okay, it's okay! I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm Late.

Okay, here I am.

So who's the new tense girl?

She's your partner.

Hi, I'm Monica.

Hi, I'm Mon--

Nana.

Monana.

It's Dutch.

You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

Pennsylvania Dutch.

And we're dancing!

Five, six, seven, eight.

-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone, is she?

She says Marcels humping
thing is not a phase.

Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

Hey, he beat you!

She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.

What does this mean?

I have to give him up.

I can't believe it. This sucks!

You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing. . .

. . .and before you know it,
he's this Little thing. . .

. . .I can't get off my leg.

Isn't there any way you can keep him?

The vet said that
unless he's in a place. . .

. . .where he has regular access. . .

. . .to some monkey loving. . .

. . .he's just gonna get vicious.

I just gotta get him into a zoo.

-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.

We're applying to a Lot of them.
Our first choice would be a state zoo.

You know, Like San Diego.

Right?

But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

We found the girl!

-What?
-Did you call the cops?

Nope. We took her to lunch.

Your own brand of vigilante justice.

Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

She stole!
She's a stealer!

After you're with this woman
for 1 0 minutes, you forget all that.

I mean, she's this
astounding person. . .

. . .with this amazing spirit!

Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Volkswagen!

I Love that joke.

-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

It was so wild.

We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 61 5. . .

. . .only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

So when they caught on that
we were short and have breasts. . . .

They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

Go, Monana!

Well, you ladies are not
the only ones Living the dream.

I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

Oh, by the way. . .

. . .tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

Excuse me?

There's an open call for Cats.

I'm thinking we go down there,
sing ''Memories'' . . .

. . .and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

Remember who you're dealing with here.

I'm not Like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

That's because of
your Amish background.

You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

Right.

Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunt.

I was just Like you.

And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my Life.

Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?

I thought that movie was
so incredibly. . .

. . .boring!

I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid. . .

. . .kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

What was that?

It's Like, ''Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! ''

As I walked out, I thought. . .

. . . ''Now that's two hours of my Life
that I'm never getting back! ''

And that scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do!

Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

Oh, God.

We didn't get into Scranton.

That was our safety zoo.

They take, Like, dogs and cows.

I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

Good boy!

See? How can nobody want him?

Somebody will.

You know, there already is
a Joseph Stalin?

You're kidding!

Apparently, he was a Russian dictator
who slaughtered all these people!

-You'd think you wouldve known that!
-You'd think I wouldve.

Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

Flame Boy!

Where exactly is your zoo?

Well, it's technically
not a zoo per se.

It's more of an interactive-
wildlife experience.

Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it Marcel?

Does he fight with other animals?

No, no. He's very docile.

Even if he were cornered?

Well, I don't know. Why?

How is he at handling small objects?

He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

What about a hammer
or a small blade?

Why would he need a blade?

If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns. . .

. . .you've got to give
the Little guy something.

Otherwise, it's just cruel!

He got into San Diego!

What?

We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .

He's in!

Did you hear that, Marcel?

It's San Diego! San Diego!

You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good. . .

. . .but if you give him to me, I'II
start him against a blind rabbit. . .

. . .and give you 20% of the gate.

Where have you been?

Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

Are you drunk?

No!

I'm Lying.

I am so drunk!

Oh, God!

Great. You know what?
You could have called.

I've been up here.
I've been worried--

Water rules!

Yes. Yes, it does.

The restaurant called. They want
to know if you're showing up.

Nope!

I'm going to the
Big Apple Circus today.

What are you doing? You're gonna
lose your job. This is not you!

No, it is me!

I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows. . .

. . .and pay the bills
as soon as they come in!

You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

I'm Monana!

Yes, she is.
Hold on a second, please.

Monana, it's for you.

The credit card people.

Oh, my God!

Thanks.

What?

They've arrested Monica.

How are you?

I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blues my color.

How did you know I was here?

Because. . .

. . .I'm Monica Geller.

It was my credit card you were using.

That I was not expecting.

I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

You have given me so much.

Without you,
I'd have never gotten. . .

. . .to sing ''Memories''
at the Wintergarden Theater.

Actually, you only got
to sing ''Memo--''

I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women. . .

. . .and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

There's nothing to wonder about.

You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

I'm not actually Amish.

Really?
Then why are you Like that?

You by the door, in or out?

In!

You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

At least I'm doing it!

This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67 to San Diego...

...boarding at gate 42A.

Okay, goodbye, Little monkey guy.

AII right, I wrote you this poem.

Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

Okay, bye, champ.

There's gonna be a Lot
of babes in San Diego. . .

. . .but remember,
there's also a Lot to learn.

I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.

Just say what you feel.

Marcel, I'm hungry.

That was good.

Marcel, this is for you.

It's just, you know, something. . .

. . .to do on the plane.

If you don't mind, I'd Like
a moment, just me and him.

-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

Marcel, come here.
Come here.

Come here.

Well, buddy. . .

. . .this is it.

There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

I'm really gonna miss you.

You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

You've been more than. . .

. . .just a pet to me.

You've been more Like a--

Would you leave my Leg alone?

Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

O, that I were a glove upon
that hand that I might. . .

. . .touch thy cheek!

That's fine. Thank you.

Next.

I'II be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

-Name?
-Holden McGroin.



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
-Tell him!
-Please tell him!

Shut up!

Tell me what?

You won't even look at him.

Come on. I could use another
reason why women won't Look at me.

AII right.

Last night, I had a dream. . .

. . .that you and I. . .

. . .were. . . .

Doing it on this table.

Excellent dream score.

Why would you dream that?

More importantly. . .

. . .was I any good?

Well, you were pretty damn good.

Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

I love it when we share.

You okay?

I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream!

I'm sorry.
It was a one-time thing.

I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

Hello, Rachel.

Get off!

Oh, give me! Can you see me
operating a drill press?

I don't know.
What are you wearing?

Why would you want to
operate a drill press?

For some short-term work.

Till I get back some
of my massage clients.

Pirates again?

No. Nothing like that.

I'm just such a dummy.

I taught a ''Massage Yourself
at Home'' workshop.

And they are.

Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

I could! I could do it!

What is it?

My secretary's gonna be out.

She's having one of her
boobs reduced.

It's a whole big boob story.

I could be a secretary.

I don't know if it's
your kind of thing. . .

. . .because it involves
a lot of being normal. . .

. . .for a large portion of the day.

I could do that.

-What're you playing with?
-My new beeper.

Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

Is it for dinosaur emergencies?

Help! They're still extinct!

It's for when Carol goes into labor.
She can get me wherever I am.

AII she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

See you later.

Off to see young Ethan?

Thank you.

How young is young Ethan?
Young?

He's our age.

When we were. . . .

He's a senior in college.

College?

This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

No, of course not.

It's not even an issue. . .

. . .because I told him I was 22.

-You what?
-What?

Oh, I can't pass for 22?

Well, maybe 25, 26.

I am 26.

There you go.

Can you hear that?

That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

Oh, I'm on!

Mr. Bing's office.

I'm sorry he's
in a meeting right now.

I'm not in a meeting.

Will he know what
this is in reference to?

And he has your number?

I'II see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye!

Ross says hi.

This is so fun!
What do we do now?

Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

''Most likely. ''

Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

AII right. Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

Yes?

What you doing?

Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

Belt's too tight.
Gotta change the belt.

Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

Am I out of control?

Just a touch.

Mon, I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since. . .

. . .his midterms.

Why, all of the sudden,
are you so. . .?

What?

Could tonight be the night?

I don't know. He's a great guy. . .

. . .and I Love being with him.
But, you know. . .

. . .things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

So did you shave your legs?

Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

It doesn't mean--

This is it! It's baby time.
Baby time!

AII right, relax, just relax.
Be cool.

Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

No, Andre is not here.

Third time today.

Yes, I am sure.

I do not perform
those kind of services.

Services?

Oh, services.

Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

That's right.

That's right.
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

No, you don't want me.

Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

Alrighty, bye-bye.

How was the first day?

Excellent!
Everyone was so, so nice!

It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

Me.

-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why not?

Well, because, you know.

They don't Like you.

What?

I thought you knew.

Who doesn't Like me?

Everyone.

Except for. . . .

No. Everyone.

What are you talking about?

Don't feel bad.

You know, they used to
Like you a Lot.

But you got promoted,
and now you're. . .

. . .Mr. Boss Man.
You know, Mr. Big.

Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

I can't believe it.

Yeah. They even do you.

They ''do'' me?

You know, Like, okay.

''Could that report be any Later?''

I don't sound Like that.

Yeah, you do.

''The hills are alive
with the sound. . .

. . .of music. ''

''My scone!

My scone! ''

I don't sound Like that.
That is so not true.

That is so not--
That is so not--

That--
Oh, shut up!

-Did not!
-I'm telling you, up until I was 9. . .

. . .I thought gunpoint was
a place where crimes happened.

How's that possible?

It's always on the news.

''A man is being held up at Gunpoint. ''

''Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint. ''

And I kept thinking,
why do people continue to go there?

I should go.

-Unless--
-What?

Unless you wanna stay over.

I mean, I'm going to. So. . . .

Yeah, I'd really Like that.

Before we get into any
staying-over stuff. . .

. . .there's something you should know.

Is this, Like,
''I have an early class tomorrow'' . . .

. . .or ''I'm secretly married
to a goat''?

Well, it's somewhere in between.

You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not. . . .

Well, I mean, I haven't ever. . . .

Ethan?

Are you a virgin?

Well, if that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then. . .

. . .yes, I am.

I am. I've kind of been
waiting for the right person.

Really?

You do know I was talking
about you, right?

Wow!

You keep saying that.

You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man. . .

. . .it is nothing Like that.

Listen, listen.

You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

Don't tell me I did it wrong.

Nothing wrong about that.

Here goes.

I'm not 22.

I'm 25. . .

. . .and 1 3 months.

But I figure that shouldnt
change anything.

What does it matter how old we are?

Listen. . .

. . .as long as we're
telling stuff. . .

. . .I have another one for you.

I'm a little younger than I said.

You're not a senior?

Oh, I'm a senior. . .

. . .in high school.

What we did was wrong.

I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial!

I just had sex.

Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

You never told me your age.

That's different!

My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states!

-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling--

Don't say it!

In Love with you.

Really?

Sorry.

Well, fall out of it.

You shouldnt be here.
It's a school night!

Oh, God!

I'm Like those women
that you see. . .

. . .with shiny guys named Chad.

I'm Joan Collins.

Who?

Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

Alrighty. Bye-bye.

It's just easier that way.

You told me about the last dream.

No. Forget it.

Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

AII right. Fine.

You were not the only one there.

Joey was too.

AII right.

Was there. . .

. . .anybody else there?

No.

You sure? Nobody. . .

. . .handing out mints or anything?

No, just the three of us.

So was it you and Chandler. . .

. . .then you and me
or you, me and Chandler?

-You know what?
-What?

There were times. . .

. . .when it wasn't even me.

That is so sweet, you guys!

Mon, Ethan called again.

What?

Ethan called again.

You're not seeing him anymore?

No.

Sometimes, just things don't work out.

This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

I didn't say any--
I did not say anything. I swear.

He stopped by.

Next time you talk to him. . .

. . .could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

Sorry.

''It's morphin time! ''

-Stegosaurus!
-Tyrannosaurus!

I gotta go.

Head rush.

One more, and then I have to go.

Cool.

Where you going?

A birthday party
with some work people.

Work people?

Nobody told me.

No, I know.
That's part of the whole. . .

. . .them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

I don't get it. A month ago,
these people were my friends.

Just because I'm in charge,
I'm not a different person.

Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

-You think I should?
-I really do.

But could we not go together?

I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

Last night was great.

You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory. ''

You were great!
But they still made fun of you.

What?

Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy.
Boss Man Bing!

Then I don't get it.

Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

You're, Like, the guy
in the big office.

You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

They say you're a great boss.

They do?

But they're not
your friends anymore.

-I just want--
-But you can't.

But I just want--

Are you gonna--

Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 . . .

. . .it means she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

What about Andre?

He got a call from what I think
was our cousin, Nathan.

Frankly, it was a Little more
than I needed to know.

That was gonna be my opener.

Did you guys check out those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

Look, I gotta tell you something.

I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was cute and vulnerable.

I'm actually 30.

I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

This is ridiculous.
We are great together!

We can talk. We make each other
laugh. And the sex. Oh, man!

I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great!

-It was.
-What's the problem?

Ethan, it's. . . .

It's icky.

''Icky''?

You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

This isn't easy for me either.

I wish things were different.

If you were older
or I was younger. . .

. . .or we lived in biblical times. . .

. . .I could really--

No, don't say it.

Love you.

-Are your hands still wet?
-They're moist.

Let's dry them again.

Or, Like, ''Could these margaritas
be any stronger?''

Hey, Chandler.

Hello, Mr. Bing.

Loved your Stevie Wonder Last night.

Thanks. About the weekly numbers. . .

. . .I'm gonna need them
on my desk by 9:00.

-Sure.
-No problem.

You have to give them something.

That was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

Well, some people are
gonna be working. . .

. . .this weekend.

Oh, that's nice.

Ross!

I'm here.

You are?

We were just. . . .

What?

Great. Now I'm having a baby.

What?

I'm having a baby! I'm having a--

-The phone, the phone!
-I don't have the phone.

I'm hurt.

Monica, let's go!
Come on, people! Woman in Labor!

-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.

What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital!

I can't Look nice?
There are doctors there.

-Joey, get out of the fridge!
-AII right, all right!

-What is that?
-For the ride.

-Like in a cab--
-Save it!

Hating this.

Monica, come on, now! Let's go!

Baby coming!

I can't believe I'm gonna be
an aunt!

I'II have a nephew!

That's nice. Get out!

AII right, I'm going.
I'm going.

Here we go. Come on.

She's not here yet! She's having
my baby and she's not here!

It's fine.
Has her water broken yet?

I don't know.

She told me she'd already
passed the mucus plug.

Do we have to know about that?

What'll you do when
you have a baby?

I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

I don't believe this!
She could be giving birth in the cab!

Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction. . .

. . .and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

You have to pick your moments.

-Did I miss it?
-She's not even here yet.

What's with the guitar?

I thought we might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

I wanted a stuffed animal.
Susan wanted a Chunky.

Susan wanted a--
You're having a baby!

You don't stop for Chunkies!

I used to have that bumper sticker.

I got an extra one.
You want this?

-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

How are your contractions?

I love them! Each one's
like a little party in my uterus!

They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

Quartz.

Swiss quartz.

Am I allowed to drink anything?

Ice chips.
They're at the nurse's station.

-I'II get them!
-No, I'm getting it!

Thought you might Like
some ice chips.

-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else, I. . .

. . .do not believe we have met.

I'm Rachel Greene.

I'm Carols ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

It's nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

Oh, that's funny!

I want a baby!

Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

Get up. Come on,
let's get some coffee.

Okay, because we never do that.

Shoot, shoot, shoot!

Or just fall down.
That's good too.

Knick fan?

Oh, boy, do they suck!

Listen, lady--

Look!

Look at your man, Ewing.

Nice shot. He couldnt hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

And who do you Like?

-Celtics.
-Celtics?

They couldnt hit a boat if--

Wait. . . .

They suck, all right?

Shut up!
It's a rebuilding year--

Let me get the father!
We need a father over here!

There's no father.

Oh, sorry.

That's okay. I'm fine.

Okay. AII right.
Right this way.

AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

And you cry and you cry
And you cry

And you cry and you cry
And you cry

-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

No fair!

I don't even have one!
How come they get two?

You'll get one.

When?

Tell you what. When we're 40,
and if neither of us are married. . .

. . .what do you say
we have one together?

Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

I just meant hypothetically.

''Hypothetically,'' why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

Well?

Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack!

Look at you, dressy-dress.

Did you go home and change?

It's an important day.
I want to Look nice.

Has Dr. Franzblau been by. . .?

I haven't seen him.

Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

What if the baby needs him?

What's the deal with you
and doctors?

Is your father a doctor?

Yeah. Why?

No reason.

Mom, we've been through this.

No, I am not calling him.

I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk!

No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

What do you mean, ''Joey who''?

Joey who?

-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

Hold on.

She wants to talk to you.

Take the phone!

Yeah, it's me.

We're just friends.

Yeah, I'm single.

Twenty-five.

An actor.

She's not much of a phone person.

So what's the deal
with this father guy?

If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood?

Look, maybe I should just go.

Maybe you should.

Good luck. . .

. . .and take care.

Know what the Celtics' problem is?
Players run the team.

That is so not true!

-Oh, it is!
-It isn't!

-Breathe.
-Breathe.

You're gonna kill me!

-Fifteen more seconds! 1 4, 1 3, 1 2--
-Count faster!

It'll be okay!
Just keep focusing on Jordy!

Who the hell is Jordy?

Your son.

I don't have a son named Jordy.

We all agreed,
my son's name is Jamie.

Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend. . .

. . .so we went back to Jordy.

What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy!

We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse/ Cody/Dillon fiasco.

Cramped leg!

-I got it!
-I got it! I'm doing it!

You get to sleep with her!
I get the cramps!

No, you don't!

That is it!
I want both of you out!

-She started it!
-He did!

I don't care! I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here. . .

. . .and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

-Thanks a lot.
-See what you did?

-Listen--
-Out!

Breathe! Breathe!

What is that?

Something exploded!

It's just her water breaking.
Calm down!

Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

Breathe. Breathe.

Oh, please!
This is so your fault!

How is this my fault?

Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

There's a Lot Carol never did
before I came along.

-Are you trying to be clever?
-You are so threatened by me!

Hey! Okay! AII right!

That's it! Get in here!

My God, you guys!
I don't believe you!

There are children
coming into the world here. . .

. . .and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should hear!

So just stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

Don't make me do this again!
I don't Like my voice Like this!

Who wants to hear something ironic?

-Help!
-Come on!

-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

Everyone stand back.

Are they here yet?

Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

Anyway, you were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful!

There was this great Little
pastry shop right by my hotel--

There you go, dear.

Come on, Lydia, you can do it!
Push!

Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder!

Push him out, push him out!
Way out!

Let's get that ball and really move!

Let's get--

I was just--

Push, push, push!

What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

Help! Help!

And they found their bodies
The very next day

And they found their bodies
The very next--

Mom, everything's going fine.

Ross is great.

He's in a whole other place!

No, he's gone.

No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

What do you mean,
''This might be your only chance''?

Would you stop?
I'm only 26.

I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

Mazel tov!

It could be one hour or three.

But relax.
She's doing great.

So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

Not at the moment, I'm not.

Are you?

No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know. . .

. . .where I do.

I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

But it's hard when,
when you do. . .

. . .what I do. It's Like. . . .

Well, for instance,
what do you do?

I'm a waitress.

Aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day. . .

. . .and you're, Like:

''If I see one more cup of coffee'' . . . .

Gotcha.

-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

How did you know I was here?

Your mom called me.

So is this her?

No, this is a loaner.

Listen, I'm sorry
you had to do this by yourself.

I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
nurse and a helper guy.

So did you see who won the game?

The Knicks by 1 0.
They suck!

They're not so bad.

Come on! Come on!

Damn it! Damn it!

Damn it, damn it!
This is all your fault!

This should be
the greatest day of my Life!

My son is being born,
and I should be in there!

Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you!

I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have!

Believe me, no one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

And you know what's funny?

You get to go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

You get to be his father!

And who am I? There's Father's Day!
There's Mother's Day!

There's no Lesbian Lover Day!

Everyday is Lesbian Lover Day!

This is so great!

Do you wanna explain that?

I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left. . .

. . .and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

I barely had enough pieces
of parents to make one whole one.

And here's this baby who has
three whole parents. . .

. . .who care so much that they fight
over who gets to Love it the most. . .

. . .and it's not even born yet!

It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

I'm sorry. You were fighting.

Where are they?

-I'm sure they'll be here soon.
-They wouldnt miss this.

Relax! You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

You are really frightening me.

Help me!
Trying to rip out my heart!

That's great!
Anybody seen a nipple?

Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

AII right, time to start pushing!

But they're not here yet!

I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

Oh, God!

Okay, got the vent open.

I'm Ben.

I'm hospital worker Ben.

It's Ben to the rescue!

Ben, you ready?

Give me your foot.

On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

What do you see?

I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

Wait!

Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent!

Pheebs, it's open!
It's open!

Wait!

You forgot your legs!

Push! Push!

We're here! We're here!

Where have you been?

Long story, honey.

I need you to keep pushing.
I need--

Excuse me, can I have this?

There's too many people here!
There's about to be one more!

So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian Life partner. . .

. . .out you go!

-Bye-bye!
-Good Luck, you guys!

Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carols Lesbian Life partner?

Out!

Here he comes!

Let me see! I've got to see,
I've got to see!

A head!

It's huge!
How are you doing this?

You're not helping!

You're doing great!
You're doing fine!

-Hello?
-Oh, sorry!

What do you see?
What do you see?

We got a head.
We got arms. We got--

Look at the Little fingers!

A chest and a stomach. . .

. . .and it's a boy, definitely a boy!

Legs, knees and feet.

He's here!

He's a person!

-Look at that!
-Who does he Look Like?

Kind of Like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

Really?

You guys, he's beautiful!

Thanks, Pheebs!

No shouting, but we still need
a name for this Little guy.

How about Ben?

I Like Ben.

Ben.

Ben's good.

How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

We just cooked it up.

That's what we were off doing.

-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on. Come on.

I know. I know.

Everybody, there's someone
I'd Like you to meet.

This is Ben.

Hi, Ben.

Ben, this is everybody.

Susan, he looks just Like you.

Thanks.

Oh, God! I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

I know.
I still am one of these.

Can I?

Okay, the head. You gotta. . . .

I'm your Aunt Monica!
Yes, I am!

I'm your Aunt Monica!

I will always have gum.

Ben. . .

. . .I want you to know that
there may be some times when. . .

. . .I may not be around. . .

. . .Like this.

But I'II still always come back. . .

. . .Like this.

And sometimes,
I may be away longer. . .

. . .Like this.

But I'II still always come back. . .

. . .Like this.

And sometimes, I'II want you to steal
third and I'II go Like this.

He is so amazing!

Yeah, I know.
Look at him!

Nothing.

I don't think that's his name.

Look, he's closing his eyes.

Look, he's opening his eyes.

He doesn't do much, does he?

Nope, this is pretty much it.

You guys wanna get some coffee?

I'II see you guys later.

Look, he's closing his eyes again.



<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
Here's little Ben nodding off.

Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.

-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

You must just want
to kiss him all over.

That would be nice.

Pardon?

Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.

Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'II pay you back.

Yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week. . .

. . .you now owe me. . .

. . . 17 jillion dollars.

Really, I'II pay you back this time.

Where's the money coming from?

I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

What kind of research?

Just, you know, science.

Science.

Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

It's a fertility study.

Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

I just go down there
every other day. . .

. . .and make my contribution
to the project.

But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

The One Where Rachel Finds Out

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

Cute, cute!

Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

So how are things going?

Is she becoming your special someone?

I don't know.
She's pretty great.

What does she think of
your Little science project?

You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

The man's got a point.

The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

Crazy bitch!

I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .

. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .

. . .if you know what I mean.

Joey, we always know what you mean.

How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna Last?

I'm going to China.

Jeez, you say one thing and. . . .

You're going to China?

It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

They don't want us
to have the bone.

So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

Hi, Ben.

I'm your father.

I am The Head!

This barbecue's gonna be fun.

Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I Left.

She's out having drinks with Carl.

Hey, who's Carl?

You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

So you do know who he is.

I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

-I have to go to China.
-The country?

No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

Do you guys know who Carl is?

Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore. . . .

Rachels having
drinks with him tonight.

How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

Forget about her.

He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

Of course, there,
they just call it food.

I guess. I don't know.

AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

I'm still on my first.

I just think you're nice.

That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''

Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
only with fruit.

-How do you Like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

Hold on there, tiger.

How are you holding up?

Well, not so good.

She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight. . .

. . .if you know what I--

And you do!

So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

What do you mean?

You know, just be there for her.

Not following you.

Think about it.

I'm guessing this is from. . . .

Well, thank you, Melanie.

This one right here is from me.

It's light.

It rattles.

It's. . .

. . .Travel Scrabble!

Thank you.

This one's from Joey.

It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.

And it's a book!

It's Dr. Seuss!

That book got me through
some tough times.

There is a Little child
inside this man.

The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

-Who's this from?
-That's Ross' .

Oh, my God!

He remembered!

Remembered what?

It was months ago.

We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.

I can't believe he remembered!

Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

It's so pretty!

This must've cost him a fortune.

I can't believe he did this.

Remember when he
fell in Love with Carol. . .

. . .and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

What did you say?

Crystal duck.

The ''Love'' part?

Oh, my God!

That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

That'll turn back time.

This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

I know.
This is really, really huge!

No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

Is there a mute button
on this woman?

I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

Did you have any idea?

No, none!

My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out. . .

. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .

What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

Given that he's desperately
in Love with you. . .

. . .he wouldnt mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

Ross?

AII this time?

-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

The country.

Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

What'll you say to him?

I don't know.

Then maybe you shouldnt go.

Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

But if it's good news,
tell him now.

Maybe I'II know when I see him.

Here, look.
AII right, does this help?

AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

I'II see you Later.

I Love you!

Deal with me first!

AII right.

Excuse me, pardon me.

Your boarding pass?

I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

This is very important.

AII right.
What's the message?

I don't know.

Excuse me! Sir!

Excuse me! Sir?

I have a message for you.

Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

What?

Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

There's no Rachel!

Don't give me that deep freeze!

Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

It was nothing.

Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

You know what?

Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

Me, again?

Sure. Why not?

Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.

How do you mean?

I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, ''Me, me, me! ''

But you. . .

. . .you're a giver.

You're, Like, the most generous
man I ever met.

I mean, you're practically a woman.

So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

It's only a Little torn.

Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

I don't know.

I don't know.

I thought about it
all of the way there. . .

. . .and I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .

You know, it's Ross!

You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

-Sure!
-Sure.

I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling. . .

. . .but I'm thinking. . .

. . .it'd be really great.

Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Like friends-in-law!

The best part is you already
know all about him.

It's Like starting on the 1 5th date.

But it would be Like
starting on the 1 5th date.

Another good point.

At the 1 5th date, you're already
in a ''relationship-py'' place.

You're committed.

What happens if it doesn't work out?

Why isn't it working out?

Sometimes it doesn't.

Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

No, I'm just--

Maybe there's someone else.

Is there?
Is there someone else?

No, there is no one else.

Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

Hey, big--

Spender!

She's still asleep.

-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

You know how you think
you're great in bed?

The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.

Well, Last night
I couldnt do the thing. . .

. . .that usually makes me great.

So I had to do
all this other stuff.

And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!

I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

It was amazing,
and not just for her.

For me too!

It's Like, all of a sudden
I'm blind. . .

. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.

You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .

. . .on another level.

I didn't know you had
another Level.

I know. Neither did I!

Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

-From who?
-From you!

I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

Well, it's the thought.

Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

At gate 27B?

I've been thinking about it.

I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

Why?

Because I feel Like I wouldnt
just be going out with him.

I would be going out with
all of you.

There'd be all this pressure and--

No pressure, no pressure!

Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

I'm not ''so. ''

I was a teensy bit weird at first. . .

. . .but I'II be good.
I promise.

Who is it?

It's me, Carl.

Come on up.

Behind my brother's back?

Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

Seven hundred bucks!

AII right, you did it!

Do we have any fruit?

Man! A hell of a two weeks.

You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

So you'll stick with this
''it's all for her'' thing?

What, are you crazy?

When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around Like this?

I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr. . .

. . .in that stupid electric car. . .

. . .I'II shoot myself!

Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se. . .

. . .it's just that guy!

I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

Fine, just stop thinking about me.

Can't do it, can you?

So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

Rachel, come on.

Give us a chance.

It's too hard.

Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

Who cares?
This is about us.

I've been in Love with you
since the ninth grade.

-You're, Like, my best friend.
-I know.

If we broke up, and I lost you--

Why do you think
we'll break up?

Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

No.

But it only has to happen once.

You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

Right?

So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

I don't know.

I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

Well start Looking!

Exactly!

And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy. . .

. . .caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

Right!

You're right!

You know what?

I forgot, I need to pick up
a friend at the airport.

I am so sorry!

If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

I'm sorry, I gotta go.
I'm sorry!

But. . . .

Excuse me! Pardon me!

I'm sorry.

Toby. . .

. . .for God's sake,
will you Let it go?

There's no Rachel!

I got that!

-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends!

Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

No, they will.
I just. . . .

-Can't wait!
-Can't wait!

Come on, they're gonna Love you.


This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.

Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...

...Iike cats, Italian guys.

And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."

When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

So she went to the airport to meet him.

She didn 't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.

That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

But enough about us.
How have you been?

The One With Ross' New Girlfriend

Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!

Excuse me.

Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

Excuse me, excuse me.

There you are!

So, so....

How was China? You!

It was great.

What happened?

-You're bleeding.
-I am?

Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

Well, where do I start?

This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

These are....

These are...

...aren't for you.

These are for you.

Welcome to our country.

Thank you. I'm from New York.

No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

Baggage claim?

I'm telling U.She went to the airport, 
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.

Oh, my God! This is huge!

This is bigger than huge.
This is....

All right, what's bigger than huge?

This?

Guys, you got new haircuts!

Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

Because, you know, "lf you don't
look good, we don't look good."

I love that voice!

And the winner is Eva Godna!

Airport. Airport. Ross.

Not alone.

Julie.

Arm around her!

Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

I think she's trying
to tell us something.

Quick, get the verbs.

You! You!

You said he liked me!

You!

You slowpokes!

That's all right.
We got the bags.

This is my sister, Monica.

This is Chandler.

Phoebe, hi.

Joey.

Everyone, this is Julie.

Julie.

But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

-With the screaming guy
-And the spitting.

You gotta hear this story.

We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

Two hundred, at least.

And the chicken poops in her lap!

I'm so sorry.

I just gave away the ending, didn't l?

I just heard this story in the cab...

...and it is all I can think about.

This is amazing.

How did this happen?

We were in grad school together.

We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

...guess who's in charge of the dig?

Julie!

Isn't that great?

Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

It's an expression.

We just wanted to say a quick hi.

-Then we'll see the baby.
-Then get some sleep.

It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

Bye!

-Can I get some coffee?
-Sure.

-Did you talk to him yet?
-No.

Then, no.

What the hell happened to you in China?

When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

I know I was.

But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

God?

It was you, pal.

Maybe it was God doing me.

You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

And then I met Julie...

...and we're having a great time.

I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

Well, you owe me one, big guy.

Your lemonade.

I didn't order it.

Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

So what did you find out?

He said....

He said....

They're having a great time.

I'm sorry.

But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

...without any outside help whatsoever.

How is that a silver lining?

You have to really wanna see it.

Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

Hey, Pheebs.

You know what I'm thinking?

How...

...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

So what were you thinking?

You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

No.

Why not?

Because I'm just....

I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

No, you're not.

I know I'm not, but you are.

I was trying to spare your feelings.

Hold on.

Ross, Julie for you.

Anybody know a good tailor?

You need clothes altered?

No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

He did my first suit when I was 1 5.

No, wait, 1 6.

No, excuse me, 1 5.

All right, when was 1 990?

You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

Okay, bye.

That is so sweet.

Okay. No, you hang up.

No, you

One, two, three.

You didn't hang up either.

She didn't hang up.

No, you hang up.

You. You.

Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

Rachel.

I'll just call her back.

Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

No, you hang up.

How did this happen to me?

A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

...this really great guy
that I can't have.

Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

I know you did.

I'm just gonna deal with it.

I gotta get out of here!

I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

You know, I think I was 1 6.

Please, just a little bit off the back.

I'm still on "no."

Morning.

Could you close your eyes for a sec?

No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

What's going on?

I sort of did a stupid thing last night.

What stupid thing did you do?

Why don't you just go get dressed...

...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

How did this happen?

I kind of ran into him last night.

-Where?
-At his apartment.

Is this juice?

And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

People do stupid things
when they're upset.

My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't

But this is about your horrible mistake.

Sorry we're late.

We were....

Well, there was touching.

Hey, Ross!

What a....

What are you doing here?

I do Raquel!

So he's back?

Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

No, not a problem.

Good. Glad it's not a problem.

You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

... my pants need to be altered.

When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

He'll know what it means.

You sure he'll crack that code?

It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

All right.

But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

...and all Monica about it.

I promise.

All right, let's see.

Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

-That's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything!

But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

This is the face of
a person who, you know...

...doesn't trust a person.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

This is how he wears it.

How who wears it?

Demi Moore.

Demi Moore is not a "he."

Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in 10.

That's Dudley Moore!

I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

Oh, my God!

Oh, God!

Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

Which one is Demi Moore?

She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

She's got gorgeous hair.

I know!

How long do you want the cuffs?

At least as long as I have the pants.

I just got that.

Now we'll do your inseam.

How is she?

It's too soon to tell.

She's resting, which is a good sign.

How's the hair?

I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

Can we see her?

Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

Ross, you come on in.

Well, how you doing?

I'm okay.

That bad, huh?

Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

It's one of my gifts.

Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

... 50 feet of crap...

...then me.

Tell Ross how you feel.

Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

I don't know. I don't know.

I've been with my share of women.

I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

But the point is...

... I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

Really?

Yo, paisan!

Can I talk to you for a sec?

Your tailor...

...is a very bad man!

What are you talking about?

Hey, what's going on?

Joey's tailor...

...took advantage of me.

No way! I've been going
to the guy for 1 2 years.

He said he was gonna do my inseam.

Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite

What?

Cupping.

That's how they do pants!

First they go up one side,
they move it over.

Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

What's the matter with you?

What?

That's not?

Oh, my God!

Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

I like it.

I do. I think it's a 10!

Thank you.

My hair is very amused.

Come on, things could be worse.

You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

I know it's crazy, but it's true."

Thank you.

Well, I gotta go. Bye.

Bye, Rach!

Wait, are you leaving?

That's what I meant by "bye."

Can I talk to you for a sec?

When the doctor does
that hernia test....

That's okay.

What's going on?

Well, okay, first of all...

... Paolo and I are not back together.

That was a stupid thing I did.

If I could go back in time
and do it again...

...well, I wouldn't.

Second of all....

What?

Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

... I tell you what I think...

...and the next day
you get back together with him...

...and I look like
a complete idiot?

Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

I hate him. I mean, I actually
I physically hate him.

I always have.

And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

Really?

You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

...and who gets how funny...

...and sweet and amazing...

...and adorable and sexy you are.

You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

Like the way I do with Julie.

Was there a "second of all"?

No, I think that was the whole "all."

I gotta go.

Thanks.

No, I swear to God, Dad!

That's not how they measure pants!

I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

-Yeah, I could do that.
-Really?

-You wanna do it now?
-Great!

See you.

I just wanna make
really sure this time.

Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

No.

That's Roddy McDowall.

Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

These were unbelievely expensive
and he'll grow out of them...

...in 20 minutes,
but I couldn't resist!

Look at these.

Hey, Ben.

"Just do it"!

Oh, my God!

Was that too much
pressure for him?

-ls he hungry already?
-I guess so.

You know, it's....

Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

I gotta get one too.

Hey, what are you guys doing?

We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

Ladle?

Will you guys grow up?

This is the most nature beautiful
thing in the world.

Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.

Carol's fine with it.

Carol?

I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

Sure.

Does it hurt?

It did at first, but not anymore.

Chandler?

So, how often can you do it?

As much as he needs.

Okay, I got one, I got one.

If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

The One With the Breast Milk

-Any muffins left?
-Yeah, I forget which ones.

You're busy, I'll get it.

-Anyone else want one?
-No, thanks.

You're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

-There you go.
-Thank you.

What a bitch!

I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

...and he wants to abuse his discount.

Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

-I'll go with you.
-Great.

-Hi, honey.
-Hey, sweetums.

And hello to the rest.

You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

Will it be a problem?

You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

Monica, she will kill you.

She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

It's actually not that big a deal.

It's a big deal to me.
This is great.

I really appreciate this.

You're welcome.

Bijan for men?

Bijan for men?

-Hey, Annabel.
-Hey, Joey.

Did you hear about the new guy?

Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man. "

Hombre?

What's he doing in my section?

I guess he doesn't know.

Well, he's gonna.

I'll see you a little later, okay?

Hey, how you doing?

Mornin'.

Listen, I know you're new...

... but it's understood
that everything...

...from young men's to
the escalator is my territory.

"Your territory"?

-Bijan for men?
-No, thanks.

Hombre?

Yeah, all right.

You were saying?

Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

We shopped and we had lunch.

What did I have?

-You had a salad.
-No wonder I don't feel full.

Hi. What's up?

I went shopping with Monica
and I had a salad.

Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

We went shopping for....

For....

For fur.

You went shopping for fur?

And then I realized
that l'm against that.

So then we bought some....

Boobs.

You bought boobs?

Bras!

We bought bras!

We bought bras.

Bijan for men?

Bijan for men?

Bijan for....

Hey, Annabel.

I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

Actually, I sort of have plans.

You ready, Annabel?

You bet.

Maybe some other time.

It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

Bijan for men?

Bijan for men!

And this is Funny Clown.

It's only for after his naps,
not before, or he won't sleep.

We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

This is so cute!

I got that for him!

"My Mommies Love Me. "

That's clever.

Oh, hi, Jul....

Hi, Jew!

Okay, sure.

That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

Did you just say, " Hi, Jew"?

Yes, I did.

That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

Ben, dinner!

Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.

I think I know
how to heat breast milk.

What did you just do?

I licked my arm, what?

It's breast milk!

So?

Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

What is the big deal?

What did you just do?

Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

You won't even taste it?

Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

-Where is everybody?
-At the park. Where have you been?

Just out.

Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

-Thanks for your jacket.
-No problem.

You can borrow it, by the way.

Here are your keys, honey.

If you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

You know what probably happened?

Someone stole my credit card.

And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

That is an excellent,
excellent question.

That is excellent.

What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

-Judy.
-Who?

-Julie.
-What?

Jody.

You were with Julie?

When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

... because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

And then one thing
led to another...

...and before I knew it, we were...

...shopping.

Oh, my God!

Wait, we only did it once.

It didn't meant anything to me!

Rachal, I was thinking
of you the whole time.

Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

That is not true!

So you just happened
to leave it in here?

Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

Okay, I just have to know one thing.

Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?

Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.

Hi, who's this?

Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

Joanne, it's not
as simple as all that.

No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

How did we do?

I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

I did not freak out.

-Why'd you freak out?
-Because it's breast milk.

It's gross!

My breast milk is gross?

This should be fun.

There's nothing wrong with it.

I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

Just taste it.

That would be no.

-Come on.
-Try it.

It's natural.

It doesn't taste bad.

Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like....

Like what?

Cantaloupe juice.

Exactly.

You've tasted it.

You've tasted it.

Oh, you've tasted it.

You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

Give me the bottle.

Get me the towel.

Howdy.

Give me a box of juice.

Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

Or this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

What do you care?

You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!

I know, but I was the best.

You know? I liked being the best.

Maybe I should get
out of the game.

They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

Say you do that.

Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

Then where you gonna run?

You're right.

I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

-I'm gonna do it!
-All right!

Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

I don't know what to say.

That's good because I'm not listening.

I feel terrible. I really do.

I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?

-It's that terrible?
-You don't get it!

It's bad enough
she stole the guy...

...who may be the person
l'm supposed to be with.

But now...

...she's actually....

But now she's actually stealing you!

What are you talking about?

Nobody could steal me from you.

Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

You're my....

And we're....

-Oh, I love you!
-I love you too!

You guys, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

But I love you guys too!

I really needed that.

I know that right now...

...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

But she didn't do anything wrong.

She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

Will you give it a chance?

For me?

I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

I'd do anything for you!

Wait, wait, wait!

Mornin'.

I said, mornin'!

I heard you.

All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

You boys ready?

Ready.

Yeah, l'm ready.

You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

You've blinded me! I'm suing!

Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

Sorry. I'm such a doofus!

I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

My God, what happened?

These new kids, they never last.

Sooner or later they all...

...stop lasting.

What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

Sure.

I just thought we should hang out.

I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

I know.

I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

... but l'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

Really?

Me?

Oh, my God, are you kidding?

Ross is so crazy about you...

...and I really wanted you
to like me, and l....

It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

Well, you're not totally paranoid.

When you and Ross
first started going out...

...it was really hard for me...

...for many reasons of which
l'm not gonna bore you with now.

I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

...and God, I hate it when she's right!

Thanks.

Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.

I'd love it too.

Shoot, I gotta go.

-So I'll talk to you later.
-All right, Julie.

What a manipulative bitch.

It's not bad.

So how was Joan?

Broke up with her.

Oh, why?

Don't tell me.
Because of the big nostril thing?

They were huge!

When she sneezed,
bats flew out of them.

They were not that huge.

I'm telling you, she leaned back,
I could see her brain.

How many women will you reject...

...over superficial,
insignificant things

Hold it. I gotta side
with Chandler on this one.

When I first moved here,
I went out with this girl.

Really hot. Great kisser...

...but she had the biggest
Adam's apple.

Drove me nuts.

-You or me?
-I got it.

Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

You guys are messing with me, right?

Yeah. We are!

That's a good one.
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

The One Where Heckles Dies

You name one woman that you broke up
with for an actual real reason.

Maureen Rasillo.

Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a real reason.

Hello, Mr. Heckles.

You're doing it again.

We're not doing anything.

You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

You don't have birds.

I could have birds.

We'll try to keep it down.

Thank you.

I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

All right, bye-bye.

Okay, Janice.

Give me Janice.
That wasn't about being picky.

We'll give you Janice.

I miss Janice, though.

Hello, Chandler Bing!

Oh, my God!

Oh, Chandler!

Now! Now!

That's it.

There! Faster!

Stop with the broom!
We're not making noise!

We won.

We did it!

Mr. Heckles!

-How did this happen?
-He was sweeping.

They found a broom in his hand.

-That's terrible.
-I know.

I was sweeping yesterday.

It could've been me.

Sweeping. You never know.

Never know.

It's very faint, but I can
still sense him in the building.

Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!

Okay, Phoebe.

I'm sorry,
but sometimes they need help.

Here we go.

That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

There are a lot of things
I don't believe in...

... but that doesn't mean
they're not true.

Such as?

Like crop circles or
the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

What, you don't believe in evolution?

Not really.

You don't believe in evolution?

I don't know.
It's just, you know....

Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I just think it's a little too easy.

"Too easy"? Too

The process of every living thing
on this planet evolving...

...over millions of years from
single-celled organisms is "too easy"?

Yeah, I just don't buy it.

Excuse me. Evolution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

Evolution is scientific fact,
like the air we breathe...

...Iike gravity.

Don't get me started on gravity.

You don't believe in gravity?

Well, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't believe in it.

Lately I get the feeling that...

...I'm not so much being pulled down
as I am being pushed.

Pushed.

It's lsaac Newton and he's pissed.

There she is. And over there,
that's the other one.

This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,
Heckles' attorney.

He'd like to talk to you.

What can we do for you?

All right, kids, here's the deal.

According my client's will...

... he wants to leave
all his earthly possessions...

...to "the noisy girls
in the apartment above mine."

What about his family?

He didn't have any.

Okay, so let's talk money.

All right, there was none.

Now, let's talk signing.

You be noisy girl number one.
You be noisy girl number two.

I can't believe that this whole time
we thought he hated us.

Isn't it amazing how much
you can touch someone's life...

...without even knowing it?

Would you look at this dump?

He hated us!
This was his final revenge!

I've never seen so much crap!

Actually, I think this apartment
sullies the good name of crap.

Check this out.

Can I have this?

How can you not believe in evolution?

I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt!

Pheebs, I've studied evolution
my entire adult life.

And we've collected fossils
from all over the world...

...that actually show the evolution
of different species.

I mean, you can literally see them...

...evolving through time.

Really? You can actually see it?

You bet! In the U.S.,
China, Africa, all over!

See, I didn't know that.

Well, there you go.

So now the real question is,
who put those fossils there and why?

Look at this!
My Big Book of Grievances.

Hey, there's me!

"April 1 7th, excessive noise...

... Italian guy comes home with a date."

You're in here too.

"April 1 8th, excessive noise...

... Italian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cleaning."

Well, that's excellent.

Look at this lamp.

Is this tacky or what?
We have to have this.

I think we have enough regular lamps.

What? Come on, it's not like...

... I'm asking for this
girlie clock or anything.

Which, by the way,
I also think is really cool.

Look, it doesn't go
with any of my stuff.

Well, what about my stuff?

You don't have any stuff.

You still think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

Yes, you do.

You think of it as your apartment
and I just rent a room.

While you "mmm" on that,
I'll go find a place for my new lamp.

Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making
these little toys move?

Opposable thumbs!

Without evolution, how do you
explain opposable thumbs?

Maybe the Overlords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

Tell me you're joking.

Look, can't we say that you believe
in something and I don't?

-No, Pheebs, we can't.

No, what's that all about?

What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

Is there blood coming out of my ears?

Check it out.
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

He looks so normal!

He's even kind of cute.

"Heckles, you crack me up
in science class.

You're the funniest kid in school."

-Funniest? Heckles?
-That's what it says.

Heckles was voted class clown,
and so was l.

He was right!
Would you listen to that?

I'd call that excessive.

What?

Heckles played clarinet in band,
and I played clarinet.

He was in the scale
modeler's club and I was

There was no club,
but I sure thought they were cool.

So? You were both dorks.

Big deal.

I just think it's weird, you know?
Heckles and me

Heckles and me. Me

Me and Heckles.

Hey, would you knock it off!

Have you been here all night?

Look at this.

Pictures of all the women
Heckles went out with.

Look what he wrote on them.
"Vivian, too tall."

"Madge, big gums."

"Too loud."

"Too smart."
"Makes noise when she eats."

This is me.

This is what I do.

I'm gonna end up alone,
just like he did.

Heckles was a nut case.

Our trains are on the same track.

I'm coming up 30 years behind him,
but the stops are all the same.

Bitter Town...

...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!

You know what we gotta do?
Get you out of here.

I'll buy you breakfast.

What if I never find somebody?
Or worse, what if I found her...

... but I dumped her because
she pronounces it, "supposably"?

Chandler, come on,
you're gonna find somebody.

How do you know that? How?

I don't know. I'm just
trying to help you out.

You guys will all get married...

...and I'll end up alone.

Will you promise me something?

When you're married, will you
invite me over for holidays?

I don't know what we'll be doing.

I mean, what if we're over
at her folks' place?

Yeah, I understand.

You can come over
and watch the Super Bowl.

Every year, all right?

You know what?
I'm not gonna end up like this.

I'll see you, man.

"Supposably."

Supposably!

Did they go to the zoo?

Supposably.

Hi. It's me.

Oh, my God!

Janice? You called Janice?

Yes. Janice.

Why is that difficult to comprehend?

You remember Janice, right?

Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestly cared about me.

Janice is my last chance
to have somebody.

Oh, my God!

Jeez, look how fat she got.

-Hey, it's everybody!
-Hi, Janice.

Janice, you're....

Yes, I am.

-ls it?
-ls it yours?

You wish, Chandler Bing!

You are looking at a married lady now.

Congratulations.

Sweetie, I'm sorry.

You couldn't tell me on the phone?

And what? Miss the expression
on your face? Oh, no!

Janice likes to have her fun!

You know what we haven't
played in a while?

Hide the lamp.

Monica, let it go.

Did you know
I'm allergic to shellfish?

Then you'll just have
to eat the other lamps.

It's scary scientist man.

Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

In this briefcase I carry
actual scientific facts.

A briefcase of facts, if you will.

Some of these fossils are
over 200 million years old.

Before you even start,
I'm not denying evolution.

It's just one of the possibilities.

It's the only possibility.

Ross, could you just open
your mind, like, this much?

Didn't the brightest minds in
the world believe the Earth was flat?

And up till 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smallest thing...

...until you split it open
and this whole mess of crap came out.

Are you telling me that you are
so unbelievably arrogant...

...that you can't admit that
there's a teeny, tiny possibility...

...that you could be wrong about this?

There might be...

...a teeny...

...tiny...

... possibility.

I can't believe you caved.

You just abandoned
your whole belief system!

Before, I didn't agree with you,
but at least I respected you.

But....

How are you gonna go
into work tomorrow?

How are you going to face
the other science guys?

How are you going to face yourself?

That was fun.
So who's hungry?

I am.

Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

What happened?

It was an accident, I swear.

I was putting on my jacket and
the thing and the lamp and it broke.

Oh, please, Monica!
You've always hated my lamp!

And now all of a sudden,
it's just magically, it's just broken?

Phoebe, tell her?

I didn't see it, because
I was putting on my jacket.

But I want to believe you.

Hey, Chandler. Monica just
broke my seashell lamp.

Neat.

I'm gonna die alone!

Okay, you win.

Chandler, you are not
gonna die alone.

Janice was my safety net, okay?

And now I have to get a snake.

Why is that?

If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,
I'm gonna need a thing.

You know, a hook.

Like that guy on the subway
who eats his own face.

So I figure I'll be
"Crazy Man With A Snake."

Crazy Snake Man.

Then I'll get more snakes,
call them my babies.

Kids will run past my place!

"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"
they'll shout!

You've got to get over this.

You won't end up alone.

Of course I will.

I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to actually go out with me...

...and then I bitch that there
aren't any great women out there.

You have just described...

...virtually every man
that we've ever gone out with.

You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

She's right.

You're no different than the rest.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Yes, he is.

You are totally different.

In a bad way?

No, honey, in a wonderful way.

You know what you want now.

Most guys don't even have a clue.

You're ready to take risks, be
vulnerable and intimate with someone.

You're not gonna end up alone.

You called Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone!

-You've made it!
-You're there!

You are ready to make a commitment!

Don't know about that!

What you got there?

Something else that's not yours
that you can break?

I know you like this
and I want you to have it.

It'll look good in our apartment.

Thank you.

That's fine.

You'll all be pleased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

This woman Allison from work.
She is great.

She's pretty, she's smart.
And I've been...

... holding off asking her out
in the past, because she has a...

... unusually large head.

But I'm not going to let
that stuff hang me up anymore.

Look at me. I'm growing.

You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

I'll take that.

You want his yearbook?

Some people said nice things about him.
Somebody should have it.

Gosh, this is so weird.

His whole life was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

I think it would be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

You're all going to hell.

It's really not that big!

-Taking that with you, huh?
-Oh, yeah.

You coming?

In a second.

Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

We'll try to keep it down.

My major was useless.

How often do you look in the classifieds
and see "Philosopher Wanted"?

Sure.

My God, that's a big head!

It didn't look this big in the office.
Maybe it's the lighting.

My head must look
like a golf ball at work.

Don't get hung up on it. Quick!
List five things you like about her.

Nice smile, good dresser.

Big head, big head, big head!

Mom, would you relax?

That was 10 blocks from here,
and any women won't walking alone at night.

I would never do that.

Mom, come on, stop worrying.

This is a safe street. This is
a safe building. There's nothing

Oh, my God! What are
you doing in here?!

Mom, I gotta go! IT gotta go!

Oh, my God!

That's fine, you just read the paper.

I'm gonna get a pot.

It's not for you.

Okay, that's fine.

Read the Family Circus...

...enjoy the gentle comedy....

Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God....

It's open, you guys.

Can I help you?

Does Phoebe still live here?

No, she doesn't. But I can get
a message to her.

Great. Just tell her
her husband stopped by.

Her what?

How did you do that?

The One With Phoebe's Husband

This is unbelievable, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

I'm not "married"
married, you know?

He's just a friend, and he's gay...

...and he was from Canada,
and he needed a Green Card.

I can't believe you married Duncan!

How could you not tell me?
We told each other everything.

I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get judgmental...

...and wouldn't approve.

Of course I wouldn't approve!

You were totally in love
with this guy who, hello, was gay.

What the hell were you thinking?

See? And you thought
she'd be judgmental.

I wasn't in love with him.
I was helping out a friend.

When he left town, you
stayed in your pajamas for a month.

And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

Well, didn't you?

I might have.

I can't believe you didn't tell me.

Like you tell me everything?

What have I not told you?

I don't know.

The fact that the underwear out
on the telephone pole is yours...

...from when you had sex
with Bobby on the terrace!

What?

Wait a minute! Who told you?

You are dead meat.

I didn't know it was a big secret.

Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

IKind of the same as, say...

... I don't know, having
a third nipple!

You have a third nipple?

You bitch!

Whip it out! Whip it out!

There's nothing to see! It's a
tiny bump. It's totally useless.

As opposed to your other
multi-functional nipples?

I can't believe you!
You told me it was a nubbin.

Joey, what did you think
a nubbin was?

You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that's what it was.

-Let me see it again!
-Yes, show us your nubbin!

Joey was in a porno movie!

If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody with me!

-Oh, my God!
-You were in a porno?!

I was young and I just wanted a job.

But I couldn't go through with it.

They let me be the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

...because there's people
having sex on it.

That is wild!

-What's it shaped like?
-ls it hairy?

What happens if you flick it?

So does it do anything,
you know, special?

Pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...

...to the magical land of Narnia.

In some cultures, having a third nipple
is actually a sign of virility.

You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

Are any of these cultures,
per chance, in the Tri-State area?

You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

Julie's so smart!
Julie's so special!

I wanted you to hook up
with Ross as much as you did.

But he's with her now.
You'll have to get over it.

Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.

I didn't know that's what I had to do.
I just have to get over it.

-Sassy lady!
-Where are you going?

I'm meeting Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

He's in the Capades.

-The lce Capades?
-No, the Gravel Capades.

The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy falls? Funny.

I can't believe
you'd dress up for him.

You're setting yourself up
all over again.

Okay, no.

For your information, I'm seeing him
so I can put those feelings behind me.

The reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

...to look nice for your gay husband.

Darn it, we're all out of milk.

Chandler, will you fill me up here?

I see, I see. Because of
the third-nipple thing.

Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.

-See you later, Rach.
-Bye-bye, Julie.

Come on, cut it out!

-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

What?

Come on, talk to me.

What's the longest you've been
in a relationship before...

... having the sex?

Why? Who's not?
Are you and Julie not?

Are you and Julie not having sex?

Technically?

No.

Is it because she's so cold in bed?

Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feel like school?

No! She's great. And it's not
like we haven't done anything.

We do plenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff like

No! Don't need to know the details.

No, it's just....

It's me.

I've only been with
one woman my whole life...

...and she turned out to be a lesbian.

So now I've got myself
all psyched out.

It's become, like, this...

...this thing!

You must just think I'm weird.

No, I don't think it's weird.

I think, in fact....

-ln fact, you know what I think?
-What?

I think it's sexy.

Sexy?

Let me tell you something.
As a woman...

...there is nothing sexier...

...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

No kidding?

You know what I'd do?

I'd wait.

-You'd wait?
-Absolutely. I would wait...

...and wait....

Then I'd wait some more.

Really?

I don't care if she tells you
she wants it, she begs, she pleads...

...she tells you she's gonna
have sex with another man

That just means it's working.

Women really want this?

More than jewelry.

Look at you! You look great!

Do l? Thank you.

So do you. Sparkly!

This is pretty wonderful,
Mr. Major Capades Guy!

I remember when you were just
King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.

You always said I'd make it.

Well, you know,
I'm kind of spooky that way.

Gosh, I missed you!

-I'm gonna get changed.
-Okay.

Now.

Oh! Right. Okay.

Ole!

What?

The Matador....

Ole!

Sweetie, can you
hold this for a second?

Sorry, you had a
paleontologist on your face.

But it's gone now.
You're all right.

Hi, everyone.

I wanted to thank you
for our little talk before.

No problem! So you're gonna
go with the waiting thing?

I was going to, but after
I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

Good. What did he say?

He told me to get over myself
and just do it.

I thought about what you said
and about what he said.

And his way, I get
to have sex tonight, so....

What is this in my pocket?

Why, it's Joey's porno movie!

Pop it in!

I'm fine, if you're
okay watching a video...

...filled with two-nippled people.

People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.

What's wrong with people having sex?

Well, you know, these
movies are offensive...

...and degrading
to women and females....

And the lighting's
always unflattering.

-Monica, help me out here.
-Hell, I wanna see Joey!

So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right

Oh. Never mind.

Wait a minute. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

All I say is, she'd
better get the job.

Looks to me like he's
the one getting the job.

Here I come.

See, I'm coming to fix the copier.

I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do?"

So I just watch them have sex.

Then I say Here's my line!

You know, that's bad
for the paper tray.

Nice work, my friend!

Wait, you see me again. Hang on,
the guy's butt's blocking me.

There I am. There I am.
There I am....

So what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

I kind of need a divorce.

O...

... kay.

How come?

Actually, I'm getting married again.

What?

I don't know how to tell you this.

I'm straight.

I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

You're so smart and funny...

...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties!

That's what I kept telling myself.

But you reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.

How long have you known?

I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.

I thought I was supposed
to be something else.

I'm an ice dancer, all my friends
are gay. I was just trying to fit in.

And there's actually a woman?

Her name's Debra.

Well, is she the first
that you've been with?

I've never told you this...

... but there were one
or two times back in college when...

... I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

...and wake up with
a woman next to me.

I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.

Sure.

Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way!

I don't know what to say.

You're married to someone for
six years and you think you know him.

And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay!"

I'm still me.

Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?

You know, it still
smells like monkey in there.

That saves us the conversation.

This has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

Me too. We should get going.

No! Come on, you guys!

Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.

Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

Rachel, that's all we do.

Maybe that's all we do.
What about Julie?

What about Julie?

You have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...

...and we don't really know you.

I mean, who is Julie?

What do you like?
What don't you like?

We want to know everything.

Well, that could take awhile.

So?

Who here does not have
the time to get to know Julie?

I got the time to get to know Julie.

I know her pretty well.
Can I go?

That's fine.

Let's start with your childhood.
What was that like?

In a nutshell

So, have you told your parents?

No, but it'll be okay.
They're pretty cool.

My brother's straight, so....

Here you go.

You know what?
I just have one more question.

If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

...do you think l
would have been the one...?

No. Don't tell me.

I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.

I love you, Phoebe.

So your brother's straight, huh?

Seriously.

and my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

Mrs. Gobb?

No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

What exactly is in a cobb salad?

I'm going home.

Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

Good night.

It's pretty late. You're
probably not still planning on....

No, I am.

Are you nervous?

I have done it before.

I mean, how are
you gonna handle it?

Are you gonna talk about it beforehand?
Are you just gonna pounce?

I don't know. I guess
I'm just gonna...

...see what happens.

Good luck!

What?

Nothing....

It is your first time with her,
and if the first time doesn't go well...

...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

Okay, now I'm nervous.

Maybe you should put it off.

No, I don't want to put it off!

I spent last year being
so unbelievably miserable.

And now I'm actually happy.

You know, I mean really happy.

I just don't wanna....

I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

I know.

I'm sorry.

It's not your fault.

Right.

Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

Maybe you were on the right track
with that whole "spontaneous" thing.

-Women really like that.
-Really?

I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to....

I don't know, catch me off guard
with a really...

...good kiss.

Really sort of soft at first.

And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

And then look far into my eyes...

...in a way that lets me
know something...

...amazing is about to happen.

And then, I don't know, then...

...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...

...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

And it would get kind of...

...sweaty...

...and blurry.

And then it's just happening.

Thanks, Rach. Good night!

Oh, God!

Good morning!

Well, somebody got some last night!

Twice!

Man, I sure miss Julie.

Spanish midgets.

Spanish midgets wrestling....

Julie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

I'm trying this screening thing.

If I always answer the phone,
people will think I have no life.

My God!
Rodrigo never gets pinned!

At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

This is Jade.

I don 't know if you 're still
at this number, but I was thinking...

...about how great it was.
I know it's been three years...

...but I was hoping
we could hook up again.

I barely had the nerve
to make this call...

-...so you know what I did?
-What?

I got a little drunk...

...and naked.

Bob here!

The One With Five Steaks and An Eggplant

So what have you been up to?

Oh, you know, the usual.

Teaching aerobics...

...partying way too much.

And in case you wondered...

... those are my legs on
the new James Bond poster.

Can you hold on?
I have another call.

-I love her!
-I know.

-I'm back.
-So are we gonna get together?

Absolutely.

How about tomorrow afternoon?

Do you know Central Perk?
Say, five-ish?

Great. I'll see you then.

Having a phone has finally paid off.

You do a good Bob impression...

... but when she
sees you tomorrow...

...she's gonna realize
you're not Bob.

I'm hoping that when
Bob doesn't show up...

...she'll seek comfort in the arms of
the stranger at the next table.

Oh, my God.
You are pure evil.

Okay, pure evil...

... horny and alone.

I've done this.

Yeah, everybody's here.

Hey, everybody!
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

Hi, Julie.

While Ross is on the phone...

...everybody owes me

Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

...you know...

...from like 20?

Hey, we got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

Do we need a cake?

I know it's a little steep.

But it's Ross.

It's Ross.

See you later.
I gotta go...

...do a thing!

Okay, sweetheart,
I'll call you later.

You're not going
through with this, are you?

You know, I think I might just.

What are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

Well, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

I guess I'll just stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

Can you believe
how much this costs?

Do you guys ever
get the feeling that...

... Chandler and those guys...

...don't get that
we don't make that much money?

They always say
let's go here, let's go there.

Like we can afford to go
here and there.

Yes, and we always have to go to,
you know, someplace nice.

And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday thing...

...and it's "for Ross."

For Ross.

Oh, my God!

I'm at work...

...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, saute, saute.

Suddenly, Leon, the manager,
calls me into his office.

They fired the lunch chef,
and guess who got the job?

If it's not you,
this is a horrible story.

Fortunately, it is me.

And they made me head of purchasing,
thank you!

That's so cool!

Anyway, I think we
should go out and celebrate.

You know, someplace nice.

Someplace nice.

How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

You can't do this.

I can't get a girl like that
with conventional methods.

It doesn't matter.

She wanted to call Bob. Bob could be
who she was meant to be with.

You may be destroying
their chance for happiness.

We don't know Bob.

We know me. We like me.
Please let me be happy.

Go over there
and tell that woman the truth.

All right.

Go.

Listen, I have to....

I have to confess something.

Yes?

Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

-How did you
-I don't know.

I just had this weird sense.
But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

Tissue?

Thanks.

No, you keep the pack.

I'm all cried out today.

Here is to my sister,
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

Also in charge of purchasing.

Head lunch chef,
also in charge of purchasing

Who has her own little desk
when Roland's not there.

Lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk
when Roland's not there...

-... here's to my
-Wait! And I got a beeper!

That's fine, I'll just wait.

Sorry.

Monica!

Are we ready to order?

We haven't even looked yet.

When you do, let me know.

I'll be over there
on the edge of my seat.

Look at these prices!

Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."

I know! What are these,
famous chickens?

Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations, Mon.

I'm not sorry I'm late.
How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

Pretty incredible, according to
the message on my machine.

Why is this woman leaving a message
for you on my machine?

I told her that
my number was yours...

... because I couldn't
tell her it was mine...

... because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

Tell me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

Do I dare ask?

I'll start with the carpaccio,
and then the grilled prawns.

Great, same for me.

And for the gentleman?

I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.

But if I get it without
the nuts and leeks and stuff...

...is it cheaper?

You'd think, wouldn't you?

I will have the side salad.

And what would that
be on the side of?

I don't know.

Just put it right here
next to my water.

And for you?

I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and...

...take care.

I will have the Cajun catfish.

Anything else?

Yes, how about a verse of
"Killing Me Softly"?

You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

Plus tip, divided by six....

Everyone owes 28 bucks.

Everyone?

Oh! You're right, I'm sorry.

Thank you.

It's Monica's big night.
She shouldn't pay.

So five of us is...

...33. 50 a piece.

No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

Prom night flashback.

Sorry, Monica.
I'm happy you got promoted...

... but cold cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks?

No!

Rachel just had that little salad...

...and Joey with his teeny pizza!

Okay, Pheebs.

How about we'll each
pay for what we had?

It's no big deal.

Not for you.

All right, what's going on?

I don't wanna get
into this right now.

It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

You can tell us.

Yeah, hello? It's us.
We'll be fine.

We three...

...feel like that...

...sometimes you guys don't get that....

We don't have
as much money as you.

I hear you.

We can talk about that.

Well, then...

...Iet's.

I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

-Because you have it.
-Good point!

So how come you guys
haven't talked about this before?

Because it's always something.
Like with Monica's new job...

...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

There's gonna be a hoopla?

Basically there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing

If it makes anybody feel better,
forget the thing...

...and we'll just do the gift.

Gift? The thing's not the gift?

No, we were gonna go see
Hootie and the Blowfish.

Hootie and the

I can catch them on the radio.

No. Now I feel bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

No, look. It's my birthday...

...and the important thing
is that we're all together.

-All of us.
-Together.

Not at the concert.

Thank you.

So, the Ebola virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

Gee, Monica.
What's in the bag?

I don't know, Chandler.
Let's take a look.

Oh, it's like a skit.

Why, it's dinner for six.
Five steaks...

...and an eggplant for Phoebe.

We switched suppliers at work, and
they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.

But wait, there's more.
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the hall.

Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the Blowfish!

The Blowfish!

It's on us. So don't worry.
This is...

...our treat.

Thank you.

Could you be less enthused?

Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

But it just feels like....

Like?

Charity.

Charity?

We're just trying
to do a nice thing here.

But you have to understand, your
"nice thing" makes us feel about this big.

Actually, it makes us feel that big.

I don't understand.
We can't win with you guys.

If you guys feel this big,
maybe that's not our fault.

Maybe that's just how you feel.

Now you're telling us how we feel.

We never should have talked about this.

I'm gonna pass on the concert.

I'm just not in a very
"Hootie" place right now.

-Me neither.
-Me too.

Guys, we bought the tickets.

Then you'll have extra seats
for all your tiaras and stuff.

Why did you look at me
when you said that?

So I guess now we can't go.

Do what you want. Do we always
have to do everything together?

You know what? You're right.

Fine.

All right.

We're gonna go.

It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

Are you ready?

Just let me grab my jacket
and tell you I had sex today.

What? You had sex today?

It sounds even cooler
when somebody else says it!

I was awesome. She was biting her lip
to stop from screaming.

I know it's been a while,
but I took that as a good sign.

Still doing the screening?

I had sex today.

I never have to
answer that phone again.

At the sound of the beep,
you know what to do.

Hey, Bob. It's Jade.

I wanted to tell you I was really hurt
when you didn 't show up yesterday.

And just so you know,
I ended up meeting a guy.

Bob here.

So you met someone, huh?

Yes, I did.

In fact, I had sex
with him two hours ago.

So how was he?

Oh, Bob, he was nothing
compared to you.

I bit my lip to keep from
screaming your name.

Well, that makes me feel so good.

It was just so awkward and bumpy.

Maybe he had some kind of new style
that you're not familiar with.

You have to get used to it.

There wasn 't much time
to get used to it...

...if you know what I mean.

You know what? I'm not gonna
be able to enjoy this.

I know. It's my birthday.
We all should be here.

So let's go.

Well, maybe we should stay
for one song.

It would be rude to them
for us to leave now.

The guys are probably
having a great time.

Come on, you guys.
One more time.

One.

-Amazing!
-Excellent!

I can't believe the guys missed it!

What guys?
Oh, yeah.

Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica Geller?

-Do I know you?
-You were my baby-sitter!

Oh, my God!
Little Stevie Fisher?

How have you been?

Good. I'm a lawyer now.

You can't be a lawyer.
You're 8.

It was nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

Wait, backstage?

My firm represents the band.

You guys wanna meet the group?

Come on.

Are you one of the ones
that fooled around with my Dad?

Hey, you guys!

Happy birthday!

Oh, thank you.

How was your night last night?

Oh, well, it pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

Ours pretty much sucked too.

But I ran into Stevie Fisher.
Remember him?

Oh, yeah!
I used to baby-sit him.

Hey, how's his dad?

Good.

Aside from that, the evening
was pretty much a bust.

Yeah, we really missed you guys.

Yeah, we were just saying,
this whole thing is so stupid.

We just have to really, really
not let stuff like money, get like

Is that a hickey?

Oh, no, I just....

I fell down.

On someone's lips?

Where'd you get the hickey?

You know, a party or

What party?

It wasn't a party
so much as a...

...a gathering of people.

With food and music and...

...and the band.

You partied with
Hootie and the Blowfish?

Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie
are like this.

Who gave you that hickey?

That would be the work of a Blowfish.

I can't believe it!
I can't believe this!

We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

...and you're partying
and having fun and all:

"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!"

Don't blame us.
You could've been there.

What? As part of your
"poor friends outreach program"?

Oh, great. It's work.

I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry we make more than you.

But we're not gonna feel guilty.
We work really hard.

And we don't work hard?

It's Monica. I got a page.

It's just that sometimes we like
to do stuff that costs a little more.

And you feel like we hold you back.

Leon, wait.

Guys!

I don't understand.

The steaks were a gift
from the meat vendor.

That was not a kickback.

I'll just replace them,
and we can forget the whole thing.

What corporate policy?

I just got fired.

Here's your check. That'll be $4. 1 2.

Let me get that.

You got 5 bucks?

Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

Hi, it's me.

Listen, Bob.
I'm probably way out of line here.

It's been three years, and you 're
probably seeing someone else now...

...but if we could have one night
together, for old time 's sake....

One hot, steamy, wild night....

Who the winny-binny boy?

You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

Don't cry.

Don't cry.

Why is he still crying?

Don't worry. Nothing can't be solved by happy keys.

yeah, I was feel much better when someone shaked Jacks medal in my face.

Let me hold him for a sec.

Here we go.

There we are.

Maybe it's me.

Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

There we go, all better.

There's my little boy.

Can I see something?

Cool!

He hates me.
My nephew hates me!

I'm unemployed, and my nephew hates me!

Stop, don't do this. You are just unemployed.

What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do then?

Monica, stop! This is nuts.

Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this problem?

You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

Joey, she does not look fat.

The One With the Baby on the Bus

Here you go.

Goo, goo, goo!

That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

You okay?

I don't know.

What's in this pie?

I don't know. Butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi

Kiwi? Kiwi?!

You said it was a key lime pie.

No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

That's what's gonna kill me.

I'm allergic to kiwi.

No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and

Oh, my God!

It's definitely getting worse.

Is your tongue swelling up?

Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

Get your coat.
We're going to the hospital.

-Will he be okay?
-He's gotta get a shot.

You know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

Let's not go.
Anyone up for Scrabble?

Jacket, now!

What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

We'll watch him.

I don't think so.

I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

I was gonna play basketball...

... but I guess that's out the window.

If you take him out for a walk,
remember to bring his hat.

There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

Hat, milk....

Got it!

Consider it done!

You understood?

My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

I wrote it this morning in the shower.

I'm in the shower
And I'm writing a song

Stop me if you've heard it

My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

What's up?

F Y I:

I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

Her name is Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

But what about Phoebe?

It's not that your friend is bad.

It's that she's so bad...

...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

...and swirl it around.

Okay, so you're not a fan.

But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

I have to do this to her?

Lather, rinse, repeat

And lather, rinse, repeat

And lather, rinse, repeat

As needed

We didn't bring enough stuff.

Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

It's a known fact
that women love babies.

Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

-Give me the baby.
-No, I got him.

Come on, seriously.

Oh, seriously, you want him?

Who is this little cutie-pie?

Well, don't think me immodest, but...

... me.

Want to smell him?

I assume we're talking about the baby?

He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

My uterus just skipped a beat.

What'd I tell you?

It's great you're doing this.

Well, we are great guys.

My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

What agency did you two go through?

But this is my gig.

This is where I play.

My name is written out there in chalk.

You know, you can't just erase chalk.

Honey, I'm sorry.

And he's going to
be paying this woman?

Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

That's where that came from.

You probably did everything you could.

You know what? Let me just
see what else I could do.

Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

I don't know.

I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

Of course I clean it.

I mean, I will clean it.

I mean, I will clean it.

All right, fine, fine, fine!

-Done.
-Really?

Who's working for you, babe?

Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

What?

He's paying the people
who were playing.

I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

I'm sorry, no!

No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

There are thousands of places
in this city...

...where people would pay
to hear me play.

When I play, I play for me

I don't need your charity

Thank you!

I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

...and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

...if there's any way
to treat this orally?

Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

So?

Go and have a seat. The doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

You want to squeeze my hand?

Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

Let go of my hand!

Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

...we should go to
the park and make out.

Taxi! Taxi!

Look at that talent.

Just practicing. You're good.

Carry on.

Wait, wait, wait!

Hey, you. He's just adorable.

Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

-What are you guys out doing today?
-We're not out.

We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

...of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

You done?

There's our stop.

Get out of here!
This is our stop.

You guys live around here too?

We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

You know it?

Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

So you want to go to Markel's?

Sure, they love us over there.

Where's your baby?

Ben! Ben!

That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

Stop the bus!

Are you sure he didn't break it?
It's really hurt.

No, it's just a good bone bruise.

And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

-I'm really sorry.
-It's okay.

Sorry.

Sorry! I got my S's back!

Which we can celebrate later.

Celebrate. Celebrate....

He was a double, double

Double-jointed boy

So are you the
professional guitar player?

Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

Right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

So how many chords do you know?

-All of them.
-So you know D?

Do you know A-minor?

Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

So does your guitar have a strap?

Mine does.

Stephanie knows all the chords

Come on! Pick up, pick up!

Transit Authority?

I'm doing research for a book.

I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

And there was a baby in it.

He wants to talk to you.

Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to

Terry's a jerk
And he won't let me work

And I hate Central Perk

To Stephanie Schiffer!

I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

Zachary

Are all invited to bite me

We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?!

He's here.

I assume one of you is the father.

-That's me.
-I'm him.

Actually, we're both the father.

Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

Or clowns.

That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

Hey, Ben! Remember us?

Okay, the mole came off.

What are we gonna do?

We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

-Flip for the baby?
-You got a better idea?

All right, call it in the air.

Heads.

Heads, it is.

We have to assign heads to something!

Right!

Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

Then slowly turn away

I won't beg you to stay

With me

Here. I thought you might be cold.

Thank you.

Look at you!
You did pretty well.

$8. 27.

But not really, because
I put in the first two.

Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

Do you?

You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

I don't know, when l
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

... I got, like, $ 1. 75.

But then "Smelly Cat"?

I got 25 cents and a condom.

So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat."

Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat."

I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

But it's not even that, you know?

I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

Well, people missed you in there.

In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat."

Really? From who?

Well, me.

And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

It's kind of an emergency.

-Here you go.
-Thanks a lot.

Hey, Christine! I got it!

I want to thank you
for being there for me.

And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand.

That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

...and you hit your head on the curb?

But I remember
people telling me about it.

I hope Ben has a little sister.

And I hope she can kick his ass.

I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

That was you?

They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

My little nephew.

Come here, little one!

There's my little baby, Ben!

Hey, he's not crying!

Hey, he's not crying!

There's still pie!

I'm here. I'm here.

How's my little boy?

You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

He rode the bus today.

Big boy riding the bus

Hey, I have a question.

How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

You are gonna love this.

Can you hold Ben for a sec?

Come here. Come here.

Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?

No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

Smelly cat, smelly cat

Smelly cat, smelly cat

Better!

Much better. Good.

Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

-You want to try it again?
-From the top?

There is no "top," all right?

That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."

Why don't you just follow me.

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?

Smelly cat, smelly cat

It's not your fault

That's too much. Sorry.

What is it about me?
Do I not look fun enough?

Is there something
repellent about me?

How was the party?

It couldn't have been worse.
A woman literally passed through me.

What is it?
Am I hideously unattractive?

No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

I go through the same thing.

When I put on a little weight,
I question everything.

I've put on weight?

Did you want to...?

No, not weight.
More like insulation.

I'm unemployed,
in dire need of a project.

Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

I would, but that might get
in the way of my lying-around time.

Please?

Come on, let her do it!

All right.

If we put on spandex and my boobs
are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

Your boobs are fine.

I shouldn't have said anything.

Come here. Come here!

Can't make hands meet!

The One Where Ross Finds Out

Let's do it!

What?

Nothing. Just never seen
your little stretchy pants before.

It's cute!

And we're changing.

Come on, give me five more!

Five more!

Five more and I'll flash you.

One...

...two...

...two and a half.

Just show me one of them.

She's insane!

The woman is insane.

It's before work, after work,
and during work.

She's got me doing
butt-clenches at my desk.

And now they won't
bring me my mail anymore.

Just tell her you want to stop.

I can't. All she get to work is all she can got.

So that's why we think maybe we should all picking and buy her own resterant.

Hey, Pheebs.
How'd it go with Scott?

It was nice. Took him
to a romantic restaurant...

...ordered champagne. Nice.

He still won't put out?

Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

Sorry, Pheebs.

Look, I don't mind taking it slow.

I like him a lot.

He's really interesting,
and he's really sweet.

Why won't he give it up?

Maybe he drives his car
on the other side of the road.

If you know what I mean.

No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

Maybe he's gay.

I don't think that's the problem.

We went dancing
the other night...

...and just the way he held me so close
and looked into my eyes....

I just definitely felt something.

But how much can you
tell from a look?

I felt it on my hip.
I could tell.

Yo, Bing!
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand
and smack her with it.

Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

What?

I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

You have a date?

Monica's setting me up.

What about Ross and....

What? My whole
insane jealousy thing?

Well, you know,
as much fun as that was...

... I've decided to opt for sanity.

You're okay about all this?

Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

He can press her up against
that window as much as he wants.

For all I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

Hi, guys.

Monica, I'll come by tomorrow and
pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?

If you say his full name.

Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

All right.

-You're getting a cat?
-Actually, we're getting a cat.

Together?

Both of you? Together?

It'll live with Ross half the time
and with me half the time.

Well, isn't that just lovely?

That's something you'll enjoy...

...for a really, really,
really long time.

Hopefully.

Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

With a man.

You guys have a really good night...

...and you two have a really good cat.

We're not supposed to
take these when we leave.

I don't know if Monica told you, but
this my first date since my divorce.

If I seem a little nervous...

... I am.

How long do cats live?

I'm sorry?

Cats. How long do they live?

Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus or something?

Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.

Well, that's just great.

Cheers!

Right. Clink.

Monica told you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

No, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just....

It's this thing.

It's not as bad as it sounds...

... but this friend of mine is
getting a cat with his girlfriend.

Oh, that does sound....

He just started going out with her.

Is this guy an old boyfriend?

Yeah, he wishes.

I'm sorry. Look at me.

Michael, let's talk about you.

So....

Did you ever get a pet
with a girlfriend?

-So I figured it out.
-What?

Why Scott doesn't want
to sleep with me.

I'm not sexy enough.

Phoebe, that's crazy.

When I first met you,
you know what I said?

I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

Really? That's so sweet.

I mean, I'm officially offended.
But that's so sweet.

If you wanna know what the deal is,
you're gonna have to ask him.

You're right. You're right.

You are so "yum"!

I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

Why can't they get a bug?
One of those fruit flies.

Those things that live for a day.

What are they called?

Fruit flies?

Thank you.

Would you like dessert?

No dessert.

Just the check. Please.

Oh, no. You're not
having fun, are you?

No, no, I am.

But only because I've been playing
the movie Diner in my head.

Oh, look at me.

Look at me.

I'm on a date
with a really great guy.

All I can think about is Ross...

...and his cat...

...and his Julie.

Look, do you want a piece of pie or something?

Do like that man, I just screwed this all over.

I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

Look, I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you're gonna be fine.

You can't see it because
you haven't had closure

Closure!

That's what it is!
That's what I need!

God, you're brilliant!

Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

Well, there's no one way
really, it's just....

Whatever it takes so that
you can finally say to him:

"I'm over you."

Over you.

That's what it is.

Closure.

Hello? Excuse me?

Excuse me. Hel

-Hang on.
-Excuse me?

-What?
-Hi. I'm sorry.

I need to borrow your phone
for just one minute.

-I'm talking.
-I see that.

One phone call, I'll be very quick.
I'll even pay for it myself.

You're being a little weird
about your phone.

All right. Fine.

I'll call you back.

Thank you.

So good people!

Machine.

-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

I'm just calling to say that...

...everything's fine.

And I'm really happy for you...

...and your cat.

Who, by the way, I think
you should name Michael.

You see there,
I'm thinking of names...

...so obviously I am over you.

I am over you.

And that, my friend,
is what they call "closure."

It's Sunday morning.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

It's God's day.

If you say stop, then we stop.

Stop.

No, come on! We can't stop!

We got three more pounds to go!

I am the energy train
and you are on board!

And how was the date?

I think there was a restaurant.

I know there was wine.

Actually, Julie's getting a cab.

I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....

What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

I'm sorry. I don't know, l....

I feel like I dreamed
about you last night...

... but I don't remember.

There they are.

Did we speak on the phone?
Did you call me?

No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

I haven't even been home yet.
Do you mind if I check my messages?

Oh, yeah, go ahead.

Rach, I got a message from you!

Who's Michael?

Oh, my God!

Ross, no! Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

Give me the

You're over me?

Oh, God!

-You're
-Oh, God.

You're over me?

When were you...

... under me?

Rachel, do you...?

I mean, were you?

What?

Basically...

...Iately, I've....

I've sort of had feelings for you.

You've had feelings for me?

So? You had feelings for me first!

You know about my
You know I had

You know?

Chandler told me.

When did he? When did he?
When did he?

When you were in China.

Meeting Julie.

Julie. That's
Oh, God!

I need to lie down.

No, I'm gonna stand.

I'm gonna stand...

...and I'm gonna walk.
I'm walking and I am standing.

Now you're over me?

Are you over me?

That's Julie.

-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.

I'll be right down!

Wait, so you're going?

Well, okay, I have to.
I can't deal with this right now.

I mean, I've
You know, I've got a cab.

I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.

Cat!

-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

How come you're watching
a rabbi play electric guitar?

I can't find the remote.

Thank you.

Scott asked me to come over
for lunch and I did.

-And?
-And we did.

All right! Way to go!

Yea, me!

So how did it happen?

I took your advice and
asked him what was going on.

What did he say?

He understands how sex can be
a very emotional thing for a woman.

And he was just afraid
that I was going to get all:

"ls he gonna call me the next day?"
and "Where is this going?"

So he said he wanted to hold off
until he was prepared to be serious.

So I said, "Okay. Relax, please."

Sex can be just about two people
right there in the moment.

If he wants to see me again, he can
call. If not, that's fine too.

So after a lot of talking...

... I convinced him.

Let me get this straight.

He got you to beg to sleep with him.

He got you to say
he never has to call you again.

And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

This man is my god!

This one is cute. Don't you think.

Yeah. This one is cute, that one is cute, and they are all cute.

Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.

-Are you OK!
-yeah, me, sure!

You know this is the big step for us, 
but I'm got feeling that will be OK.

I know, I know!

Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.

Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.

See, we should work that out before we came down here.

I will get a little narrow down with this one over here and this one with the stricks. You pick!

-I have to pick?
-whickever one you want.

I don't know.I mean it's not easy to choose.

You know both cat are beautiful,funny.
You will be happy with either cat.

Do you want to take both?

I can't have two cats.
Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.

I didn't get a cat.

That's interesting.

No, it's not "interesting."
It's very, very not interesting.

It's actually 100%
the opposite of interesting.

I got it, Ross.

You had no right to say
you had feelings for me.

I was doing great with Julie
before I knew!

I was doing great
before I knew about you!

You think it's easy
to see you with Julie?

You should've said something before!

I didn't know then.
And how come you never said anything?

There was never a good time.

You only had a year.
And we only hung out every night!

Not...

...every night.

It's not like I didn't try.
But things got in the way.

You know, like ltalian guys...

...or ex-fiances...

...or ltalian guys.

There was one ltalian guy, okay?
And do you have a point?

The point is, I don't need
this right now!

Okay? It's too late.

I'm with somebody else. I'm happy.
This ship has sailed!

You're just gonna put away
your feelings for me?

I've done it since ninth grade.
I'm good at it.

All right, fine.
You go ahead and do that.

I don't need your ship!

-Good.
-Good!

And you know what?
Now I got closure!

Try the bottom one.

Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

We're not working out.
It's over.

No way! With one pound to go?
Come on!

We're workin', we're movin'
We're in the zone, we're groovin'

I don't mind the last pound.

In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

So don't make me do anything
that I'll regret.

What you gonna do, fat boy?

What?

Nothing. Except tell you it's
wonderful how much energy you have.

Well, thanks.

Especially considering how tough
it's been for you to find work.

You can't tell your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

Well, no. But l....

If it were me, I'd have difficulty
getting out of bed at all.

You know, I try to stay positive.

So you....

You feel like going for a run?

All right.

Because you don't have to.
You could just take a nap right here.

Ross kissed me.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

It was unbelievable!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

Let's hear everything.

Monica, get the wine
and unplug the phone.

Rachel, does this end well
or do we need to get tissues?

It ended very well.

Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.

Was it a soft brush
against your lips...

...or was it a "I gotta have you now"
kind of thing?

Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then....

Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

So was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

No, actually, first
they started out on my waist...

...and then they slid up
and were in my hair.

And...

...then I kissed her.

Tongue?

-Yeah.
-Cool.

The One With the List

All right, check out this bad boy!

Twelve megabytes of RAM,

... built-in spreadsheet capabilities...

...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 BPS.

What will you use it for?

Games and stuff.

There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

Oh, wait, here's one.

-Would you be willing to cook naked?
-There's an ad for a naked chef?

No, but if you'll cook naked, then
you might be willing to dance naked.

And then....

So how'd you make out last night?

That is funny.
That is painfully funny.

No, wait, wait.

Yeah, that's just painful.

Wait a minute.
I thought last night was great.

Yeah, it was.
But I get home...

...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...

...and I think,
"My God! What am I doing?"

Here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...

...who I care about
and who cares about me...

...and I'm just
throwing all that away?

You got all that
from saline solution?

I'm the same way.Show me a bottle of wine.
and I'm like, Wow, who am I?

Wait. We're talking about Rachel.
You and Rachel.

I've been dreaming about
me and Rachel for 10 years.

But now I'm with Julie.

So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.

Me and Julie, me and Rach

Rachel! Rachel.

-Hey, you.
-How are you?

Good. How are you?

Good.

-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

Julie!

How are you?

Good.

So everybody's here.

Everybody's good.

Good, Great, and here!

Were you gonna play something?

-Well, actually
-Play it!

All right.

-Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
-What?

Okay. Hi.

Hello. Hi. Okay.

This is a song about a love triangle...

... between three people I made up.

It's called
"Two of Them Kissed Last Night."

There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

And a guy
Let's call him Neil

Now I can't stress
This point too strongly

This story isn't real

Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside

Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly

Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie

He must decide
He must decide

Even though I made him up
He must decide

Well, this is a nice resume.

Nice, nice, nice.

Muy impressivo.

Shame! It not all true.

Forget it.

No, it's all true.
I'm just a little nervous, that's all!

I am fine now.

Mr. Rastatter, what does this
job entail? The ad wasn't clear.

Macholate.

-I'm sorry?
-Macholate.

It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

Go ahead, try a piece.

We think Macholate is
even better than chocolate.

All right.

I love how it crumbles.

-You see, chocolate doesn't do that.
-No, ma'am.

We should be getting
our FDA approval any day now.

Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

The way we see it,
chocolate dominates...

...your major food-preparation holidays.
Easter, Christmas, what have you.

But given the right marketing...

...we can make Thanksgiving
the Macholate holiday.

Wow.

Aren't you gonna swallow that?

Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.

Isn't that great?

Well, anyhow...

...we're looking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

You interested?

Abso-...

... -lutely!

I love creating recipes,
I love Thanksgiving, and now...

... I love Macholate.

Really?

Especially that aftertaste.
I tell you...

...that'll last you till Christmas.

How about Macholate mousse?

It's not...

...very Thanksgiving-y.

How about Pilgrim Macholate mousse?

What makes it Pilgrim?

We'll put buckles on it.

Did Ross call?

No, I'm sorry.

Why didn't he call?

He's gonna stay with Julie.

He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:

"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

We'll get married and have lots
of kids and dig up stuff together!"

No offense, but that
sounds nothing like her.

What am I gonna do?
This is like a complete nightmare!

I know. This must be so hard.
"Oh, no! Two women love me!

They're both gorgeous,
my wallet's too small for my 50s...

...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"

-Here's a thought
-Don't ever touch the computer.

Ross, listen.
I got two words for you:

Threesome.

You still have another word if you have not use.

Hey, I think I know what is it, HELP!

Let's get logical about this.
We'll make a list.

"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."

We'll put their names
in different fonts...

...and I can use different
colors for each column.

Can't we use a pen?

No, Amish boy.

Let's start with the cons
because they're more fun.

Rachel first.

I don't know.

I mean....

All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

You could say that.

I guess, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?

And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.

And Julie and I have
a lot in common...

... because we're both
paleontologists, right?

But Rachel's just a waitress.

Waitress.

Got it.
You guys want to play Doom?

Or we could keep doing this.

What else?

I don't know.

Oh! Her ankles are a little chubby.

Okay, let's do Julie.

What's wrong with her?

She's not Rachel.

This is pumpkin pie
with a Macholate crust.

This is Macholate cranberry cake,
and these are Macholate-chip cookies.

Just like the lndians served.

Oh, my God!

"Oh, my God" good?

Oh, my God! I can't believe
you let me put this in my mouth.

Sweet Lord!
This is what evil must taste like!

I tell you, it won't print.

I pressed that button, like, 100 times.

For a hotline, you're not so hot.

What is that in the background?

Are you watching Star Trek?

So how was going with Julie. 
Did you break her heart?

It was horrible. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

I did the right thing.

So Spock actually hugs his father?

Hey, do you guys have

Where you going?

I just got back...

...from Julie's.

No, no.

It's not what you think.

It's the other thing.

Well, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

Well....

He broke up with Julie!

Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!

Really?

Really.

It's always been you, Rach.

Oh, God.

Oh, this is good.

-This is really good.
-I know. I know.

It's almost....

What do you say we take a walk?
Just us. Not them.

-Let me get my coat.
-Okay. No, hey!

I'll get your coat.

He's going to get my coat.
He's going to get my coat, Joey!

Joey, I can't believe this!
This is unbelievable!

-What's that?
-What? Nothing!

-I saw my name. What is it?
-No, no, see? See?

It's printing!

It's printing!

Let me see!

Hey, someone order a coat?

Chandler wrote something about me
and won't let me see.

He won't? He won't!

Because isn't that...

...the short story you were writing?

Yes, it is a short story...

...that I was writing.

And I'm in it?
Let me read it.

No!

-Come on!
-Hey, why don't you read it to her?

All right.

"It was summer.

And it was hot.

Rachel was there.

A lonely gray couch.

'Oh, look!' cried Ned.

And the kingdom was his forever.
The end!"

That's all you wrote?
You're the worst writer in the world!

This isn't funny anymore.

There's something about me
on that paper, and I want to see it.

No, you don't.

All right, fine. If you guys want
to be children, that's fine.

I do not need to see it!

What is this?

That is....

What is this?

-Thank you.
-Good luck.

Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

"Kind of ditzy"?

"Too into her looks"?

"Spoiled"?

A little spoiled. He was supposed
to type "little," the idiot!

"Just a waitress"?

Now that was....

I mean, as opposed to....

Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

I do not have chubby ankles!

No! I

Okay, look at the other side.
Look at Julie's column.

"She's not Rachem"?

What the hell's a Rachem?

Is that a stupid paleontology word...

... I wouldn't know,
because I'm just a waitress?

Rach, come on!

It's "She's not Rachel"!

She's not....

My diary! Brilliant!

If I'd said it was my diary,
she wouldn't have made me read it.

That's true. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

I cannot believe Ross
even made this list.

-I know.
-What a dinkus!

Hey, cut him some slack.
It was Chandler's idea.

What?

Oh, good. I was hoping
that would come up.

This was your idea?

Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

Yeah. You!

Pheebs, back me up. You believe
in that karma crap, don't you?

By the way, good luck
in your next life as a dung beetle.

Rach!

Hey! Open up! Please?

When somebody does not buzz you in,
Ross, that means, "Go away."

It doesn't mean,
"Climb up the fire escape."

I just want to read you
your "Pro List."

Not interested.

"Number one:
the way you cry at game shows.

Number two:
how much you love your friends.

Number three: the way you play
with your hair when you're nervous.

Number four: how brave you are
for starting your life over.

Number five:
how great you are with Ben.

Number six: the way you smell."

What are you doing?

You want to open the window?

Oh, yeah.

-What are you doing out there?
-I'm....

You must be freezing.
You know what you need?

How about a nice, steaming
cup of hot Macholate?

Come on, open up.

Rach, come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

No.

-No?
-That's what I said.

Maybe we should go.

You don't have to go.
We're done.

I know how you must

No! You don't, Ross.

Imagine the worst things
you think about yourself.

How would you feel if the person
you trusted most in the world...

... not only thinks them too...

... but actually uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of all those things.

Well, that's mighty big of you.

I said, don't go!

You know what?

If it were the other way around, there
is nothing you could put on a list...

...that would make me
not want to be with you.

Well, then I guess that's
the difference between us.

See, I'd never make a list.

I never know how long to wait
in this situation before you can talk.

Maybe a little longer.

In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusual.

Like these coconut Macholate
holiday nut bars?

I've indicated four cups of coconut
and four cups of nuts...

...and only one tablespoon
of Macholate.

Doesn't matter.

Our FDA approval didn't come through.

Something about laboratory rats.

Gosh, I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Anyhow, here's your check.

Thank you for all the trouble
you went through.

Listen, you didn't eat a lot of it
while you were cooking, did you?

Well, I ate some.

Oh, some is fine.
Some is not a lot.

So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

Is that him again?

Tell him I'd come to the phone,
but my ankles are weighing me down.

I don't think this is the best time.

Look, can you do something for me?

Sure. What?

All right.

Music?

Sure.

The next one's dedicated
to Rachel from Ross.

Rachel, he wants you to know
he's sorry for what he did...

...and he hopes you can forgive him.

See the stones set in your eyes

See the thorn twist in your side

I'll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate

On a bed of nails she makes me wait

And I'll wait without you

We've just gotten a call from Rachel
and she told us what Ross did.

It's pretty appalling.
And, Ross, if you're listening...

...I don't want to play
your song anymore.

Why don't we devote our time
to a couple that stands a chance?

Avery, Michelle's sorry
she hit you with her car...

...and she hopes you two
will work it out.

There's a room where

I can go

And tell my secrets to

In my room

In my room

Thanks for coming in again.

Not at all. I have no morals,
and I need the cash.

It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

They taste exactly
like pistachios...

... but they're made
of reconstituted fish bits.

Here, try one.

-All right.
-You're not allergic to anything?

Cat hair.

Oh, sorry.

Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

You should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

How much did you tip the super?

We were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

This year we made him cookies.

And 25 it is.

You gave cookies?

Money is so impersonal.

Cookies says someone cares.

We're broke,
but cookies do say that.

I can see that.

A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these "funny" brownies?

Not especially.

But I think they had pot in them.

So who else did you tip
with cookies?

The mailman, the super....

And the newspaper delivery guy.

Oh, my God.

What?

You're not gonna like this.

These are cookies smashed
to the sports section.

He did my crossword puzzle.

Yeah, but not very well, unless

...actually is "Bite me,
bite me, bite me."

The One With Phoebe's Dad

I can't believe
it's Christmas already.

One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

...Iords are a-leaping
and geese are a-laying.

Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

Hey, guys.

Hey, Rach.

I got you a little present.

I'll open it.

It's a Slinky!

Remember?

Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

Everyone knows it's

Just a big spring.

You're still mad
because of the whole

Horrible list of reasons
not to be with me?

How about we just call it
the "unfortunate incident"?

Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

Go nuts.

Hey, guys.

What's in the bag?

Some presents.

Come on, show us what you bought.

You know you want to.

This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

Oh, that's cute.

Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

And I got this blouse for Mom.

Ross, that is gorgeous!

Look at these authentic fake metals!

Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

...at the make-believe
military academy!

Happy "Christmas Eve" Eve.

Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

Macy's, third floor,
home furnishings.

This is my father!

This is a picture of my dad!

That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

No, it's my dad.
I'll show you.

I thought your dad was in prison.

No, that's my stepdad.

My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

How have you never been on Oprah?

Look, see? This is him.

My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

This is a picture of the frame guy...

...posing in front of
a blue screen with a collie.

It's not a blue screen.
It's just....

Maybe it was just
really clear that day.

Okay, I have to talk
to my grandmother.

Wait a minute, honey!

I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

But when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

Esther Livingston.

Gone!

Hi, Pooh.

Hi, Gram. What you doing?

Just updating the phone book.

Gram?

Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

Sure, sure.

How come?

Just, you know, to see him.

Sure. Here.

This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

And helping a little boy fly a kite.

And here he is at a graduation.

Another graduation.

Another graduation.

Is this really my father?

Is it really your fa?

Well, of course it is.

I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

...you've never lied.

All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

Oh, God.

It was your mother's idea.

She didn't want you
to know your real father...

... because he hurt her so much.

I didn't want to do it.

But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

Not impossible, but harder.

All right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

And I guess he doesn't live in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

That makes no sense.

Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

Honey.

Anyway, that's all I know.

That...

...and this.

This...

...is the real him.

I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

... but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

Who said anything about Christmas?

Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

No, nothing.

I hope she's okay.

I know exactly
what she's going through.

How do you know that?

She told us.

What do you got there, Monica?

Stuff for the party.

Aren't you guys
supposed to be shopping?

You didn't buy presents yet?

Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

Don't you have to be
Claymation to say that?

I don't think the mailman
liked your cookies.

The ornaments your mom sent.

Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

Hey, Rach.

I think I know what will
make you feel better.

How about you make a list about me?

Forget it.
I'm not gonna stand here...

...and make a list

Okay, you're whiny...

...you are obsessive,
you are insecure...

...you're gutless.

You don't ever just "seize the day."

You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

And you wear too much
of that gel in your hair.

See, there....

All right, you did what I said.

And you know what?
You're right. I do feel better.

Thank you, Ross.

Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

Okay. In lthaca?

All right, Saratoga?

Oneonta?

You know what? You shouldn't
call yourself lnformation!

Hello, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your real name.

Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

-How's it going?
-Not so good.

Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

Well, I think you're
better off without him.

Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

But to me, he's still
the irresponsible creep...

...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

Yeah, I know.

I wasn't completely honest with you
when I said I didn't know...

...exactly where he lived.

What do you mean?

He lives at 74 Laurel Drive
in Middletown.

If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

You can take my cab.

Thank you.

-Nobody else drives that cab.
-Got it.

I'm gonna see my dad!

Thank you.

Wish me luck, Grandpa.

Phoebe here with the cab yet?

Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

Hop in!

She'd better get here.
The stores close at 7.

It'll be two hours
to Phoebe's dad's house...

...they'll meet, chat,
swap life stories.

We'll have plenty of time.

Hey, here she comes!

Can you believe this?

In, like, two hours
I'm gonna have a dad.

Yeah, big stuff!

Okay, let's go!

Here, you have to hold this.

"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

That's my cheat sheet.

-Where's my seat belt?
-There isn't one.

The paramedics had to cut through it.

Come on, just tell me.
Please, please!

For the 16th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

-It's hot in here!
-Rach, get the heat.

Ross, turn the heat down, please?

The difference between obsessive

Ross, the heat!

Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

This way is on.

So this is...

...off.

Did you just break the radiator?

No, I was turning the knob and...

... here it is.

Well, put it back!

It won't go back.

I'll call the super.

Here, let me try.

That's right. I forgot about
your ability to fuse metal.

Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

... Not Funny!

Hi, Mr. Treeger?

It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

...and it's really hot in here.

Yes, it's hot enough
to bake cookies.

Could we have a new one by 6?

Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

We're having a party tonight.

Okay, tip the man.

If he doesn't like
our cookies, too bad.

I won't be blackmailed.

Look, if it gets a little warm...

...it can be a theme party.

Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

This is it!

Seventy-four.

So that's what this is for!

This is it.
I'm gonna meet my dad.

This is like
the biggest thing ever.

Sure is.

Here I go. I'm going in.

All right!

Good luck, Pheebs.

Here I go.

Here I go.

I'm going.

Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party.

Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

It's hard to tell
because I'm sweating...

... but I use exactly
what the gel bottle says.

An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

Ice?

Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

Monica!

Your guests are turning into jerky.

Really?
I'm perfectly comfortable.

Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

Mr. Treeger.

You said there was a party.

Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

Is it hot?
My body always stays cool.

Probably because I have so much skin.

Hey, cheese!

Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

No, I will not cave.

I'm with Mon.

All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

Mr. Treeger?

Here is $50.
Merry Christmas.

I didn't get you anything.

Here's five back.

No, that's your Christmas tip.

Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

No can do.
Like I told the girl...

... I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

Ross?

He's playing baseball.

You mean hardball?

Whatever.

What you gonna do?

Excuse me. I'm seizing.

Mr. Treeger?

Here's another 50.

Happy Hanukkah.

Will this help
with the knob-getting?

No, the place is not open
till Tuesday.

Am I not saying it right?

So you really did like my cookies?

Yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

Nice seizing...

...gel boy.

Is this mistletoe?

No, that....

That is basil.

If it was mistletoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

No, it's still basil.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Jack Frost nipping at your nose

-How far did you get?
-Mailbox.

All right, we're getting closer.

What's going on?

It's just like
a whole mess of stuff.

Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and....

Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

Yeah, maybe!
And I'll knock on the door...

...and he'll hug me,
and I'll have a dad!

I'll go to his pharmacy and
everyone will be nice to me...

... because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

So why not go knock?

Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

You know what?

I've already lost
a fake dad this week.

I don't think I'm ready
to lose a real one.

Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

You guys....

Sorry about your shopping.

Oh, that's okay.
We'll figure something out.

I know you're not going in there...

... but you think it's okay
if I go in and use his bathroom?

That's fine, never mind.

Cool, snow!

Kind of like a blank canvas.

Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,
is it hot in here!

You mind if I turn the heat down?

We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

So, Pheebs, how did it go?

Oh, I couldn't go in.

-Honey, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

So that's enough for now.

Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

The knob was broken...

...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

Rach, these are for you.

Wiper blades!

I don't even have a car.

No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do!

Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

Toilet-seat covers!

Is that what you did
while I got gas?

You guys!

And for Ross...

... Mr. Sweet Tooth.

You got me a cola drink?

And a lemon-lime!

Well, this is too much! I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

And last, but not least....

They're ribbed for your pleasure!

Slow down! The will not be
sold out at 1:00 in the morning.

I'm excited!
I've never got reviewed before!

You were so amazing as the king!
I'm really impressed.

Although you know what?

You might wanna concider wear
underwear next time.

When you sat on the throne,
you could see your...

... royal subjects.

Come on, no one wear underwear back then.

I am sure the critic will appreciate your authority.

Nice gender, by the way!

Thanks man!

Here it is! Here it is!

"The only thing worse than
the mindless adolescent direction...

...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly
unskilled portrayal of the king."

Okay, look.
That is one guy's opinion.

All right?
Pheebs, read yours.

"The only thing worse than
the mindless, adolescent direction"

Anybody have one from a different paper?

Ross, read yours.

I don't want to.

The only enjoyable moment 

was when the king has been 
hanged and he can speak no more.

Joey, they don't know
what they're talking about.

Maybe they do.

I've done this 10 years and I'm
nowhere. There's gotta be a reason.

Come on, you're just
paying your dues.

No, no, no. It's too hard.

It's not worth it. I quit.

Come on, Joey!

Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

I believe this will change your mind.

"ln a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani
achieved brilliant levels of

Continued on page 153.

sucking."

The One With Russ

It there anything else you ever wanna to be?

I used to want to be a vet.

Then I found out you have
to put your hands into cows.

Are you okay?

Just a tough day at work, you know?

Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.

I know this jacket.
This is Fun Bobby's jacket!

Where is he?
He's here, isn't he?

-Maybe.
-Don't toy with me.

Geller!

Hey, Fun Bobby!

Hey! You been working out?

Not at all.

I love this guy!

I'm so excited to hear
you're back with my sister.

-You and me both!
-So what'd I miss?

We were trying
to make Joey feel better.

Need me to pick you up?

No, I'm all right, man.

No, I'm picking you up!

No, seriously.
I don't need you to

It still works!

Before I go, does anybody else
need to be picked up?

I'm still gonna go.

See you later, babe.

Public display of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

See you.

Fun Bobby is so great.

Oh, isn't he?

I think this time it may work with him.
He makes me feel so good.

I've been feeling so lousy lately.
No job, no boyfriend.

Well, at least my cup is half full.

Half full of love!

For our two-week anniversary,
he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.

Cabin of love!

We went through
a lot of wine tonight.

I only had two glasses.

I had a glass.

Two.

I had one glass.

I had a mug full in this...

... I-got-boned-at-the-
Museum-of-Natural-History mug.

Okay, so that's what?
Two bottles.

And yet somehow we went through five?

So what?
So he drank a lot tonight.

Now that I think about it,
I don't think...

...I've ever seen Fun Bobby
without a drink.

And did you notice how
he always starts his stories with...

... "Okay, I was so wasted!"
or "Oh, we were so bombed!"

"So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!"

Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

We just happen to go to a lot
of places where you might drink.

How do you go to a wine-tasting
without having a drink?

Or to a club, or to the...

...zoo.

Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

I don't know, taste it.

Too late, you already had some.

What do you say
we make these coffees lrish?

Cake!

Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

It seems like you've been making
an awful lot of stuff "lrish" lately.

I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles
are hard to get into that flask.

Yeah, okay.

Maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

I'm worried about you.

This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

But I always made excuses,
like "I'm just a social drinker."

Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"

So, what are you saying now?

I guess I'm saying...

... I'll try and quit.

I like that you worry about me.

So, what's going on?

I am gonna try and quit drinking.

Oh! Why?

Guess who's back in show biz!

Lorne Greene?

No. You know why?
Because he's dead.

Oh, no.

This is gonna seem bittersweet now...

... but Joey, that's who!

My agent called with an audition
for Days Of Our Lives!

Kick ass!

We have to celebrate!
We should do a soap opera theme.

We could all sleep together,
then one of us could get amnesia!

When do you get off?
We'll do something tonight.

Well, actually, I'm already done.
But I kind of got plans.

You have other friends?

I have a date.

What?

With a man?

No, with Crule John.

What's so strange
about me having a date?

With Crule John.

What about Ross?

You're still mad
because he made that list?

No, no, I'm not mad at him.

I'm not really "anything"
at him anymore.

-What are you talking about?
-I don't know.

Whatever I was feeling, I'm...

... not.

But you guys came so close.

I'm sorry. You'll have
to get used to the fact...

...that I will not be dating Ross.

Here he is.

Guys, this is Russ.

I'm not saying you're not talented.
You're very talented.

But with the bird dead and all,
there's very little act left.

Honey, give me a break, will you?

I'll talk to you later.

There's my favorite client!

So tell me, darling,
how was the audition?

I think it went well.
I got a callback for Thursday.

Joey! Have you ever
seen me ecstatic?

Well, here it is.

Okay! Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

The casting lady

Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

She's great.

But I kind of got the feeling that
she was sort of coming on to me.

And I definitely would get the part
if I were to, you know....

If I sent the little general in.

I see! Well, I'm just gonna
put in a call here...

...and we'll find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

Lori, please.

Hi, darling!

How about Joey Tribbiani
for the part of the cab driver?

Isn't he terrific?

Okay, doll, talk to you later.

You're gonna have to sleep with her.

-What's the matter?
-Fun Bobby.

What? Isn't he sober?

Oh, he's sober all right.

Turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

All right, here you go, sweetie.

Thanks. You wanna
hear something funny?

Oh, God, yes!

There are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

That is funny.

I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
walking around the neighborhood.

and I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking

So you are saying you are walking

But apparently...

...there are no hardware stores open
past midnight in the Village.

So it's help for fat 

as well as funny.

Don't you have to
be at your interview?

Oh, yeah.

See you guys.

Bye...

...ridiculously dull Bobby.

Oh, my God.

He's not that bad.

Not that bad?
Did you not hear the hammer story?

Okay, don't get all squinky.

Maybe it's the kind of story
where you had to be there.

But I'm gonna be there!

For the rest of my life.

I can't dump him. I made him
quit drinking. I made him dull!

Don't say that.

He's probably always been dull.
You just, you know...

...set it free.

Hey, Ross.

Hi, Russ.

I've got two more tables
to clean, and then we'll go.

I'll just sit here and...

...chat with your...

...friend-type people.

Rachel?

So, you know what
you're doing, right?

Waitressing?

Well, yeah. But, no.
I mean....

Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

Bob Saget?

Oh, yeah!

No, no, no!

Oh, my, oh!

What's wrong?

She's upset because...

...she buttered a spider
into her toast this morning.

All right.

Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

Ross, Russ.
Russ, Ross.

Are you a friend of Rachel's?

Yes. Yes, I am.

Are you a friend of Rachel's?

Actually, I'm kind of a...

...you know...

...a date-type thing...

...of Rachel's.

A date?

I'm her date.

Oh! Oh, you're a....

Oh, you're the date.

This is actually good...

... because if we lose Ross,
we have a spare.

Oh! You are the paleontologist.

Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are a....

Periodontist.

See? Now they're as
different as night and...

...Iater that night.

Well, I am going to get a beverage.

It was nice meeting you.

Ditto.

Well, I met Russ.

Hey, I didn't know
we were seeing other people.

Well, we're not
seeing each other, so....

For your information,
there's a woman at the museum...

...who's curator of moths and other...

...winged things...

...who's let it be known that
she is drawn to me, much like a...

...you know.

I've kept her at bay,
but if this is the deal

This is the deal.

Okay, well, have a nice evening.

Russ, you ready?

She's dating?

She's dating?

Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

What do you mean?

-Do you not see it?
-See what?

I don't know what she sees
in that goober!

It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

... hello, a week
to get out a sentence?

It's annoying, isn't it?

You didn't get the part...

...or ltaly called
and said it was hungry?

The part's mine if I want it.

Oh, my God!

If I'm willing to sleep
with the casting lady.

Oh, my...

...God?

Ten years I've been waiting
for a break like this. Ten years!

I mean, Days of our Lives.
That's actually on television!

What are you gonna do?

I guess I could sleep with her.
I mean....

How can I do that?

I've got a pop-up book that told me
everything I need to know.

I've never slept
with someone for a part.

Well, is she

Sorry.

Is she good-looking?

She's totally good-looking.
If I met her in a bar...

... I'd be buying her breakfast.

After having slept with her.

Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

I just don't think that
I want it that way, though.

I mean, let's say
I do make it, all right?

I'll always look back and wonder
if it was because of my talent or...

...you know, the little general.

Didn't you used to call it
"the little major"?

After Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

Something from the bar?

Yes, I would like something.

No. No, thank you.

If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.
I've gotta get used to it.

No, no, really.
I wouldn't feel right about it.

Just some water, please.

-So my refrigerator light's out.
-Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?

Wanna do another one?
Huh, Russ?

Eleven letters...

...atomic element number 101,
ends in "ium."

Dysprosium.

Dysprosium.

Try mendelevium.

And weenie number two has it.

Unless "Knights in White Satin"
was sung by the Doody Blues.

You don't see it?
You actually don't see it?

What?

Honey, you're dating Ross.

No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

Steve, sleeve.

No one is named sleeve.

What are you talking about?

Other than their names being similar,
I do not see what you're seeing.

For your information...

...it's a card sharp,
not a card shark.

You could not be more wrong.

You could try,
but you would not be successful.

I'm gonna get some more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

I know your problem.

Oh, you do, do you?

You're jealous.

Of what?

You're jealous
because I'm a real doctor.

Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

That's the smallest body part
you can major in.

Day one, floss.
Day two, here's your diploma.

You listen here

-Let me finish.
-No, let me finish.

No, you let me fin

Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

I don't even think he knew.

Would you sleep with somebody
to get a great job?

Who would I have to sleep with?

Me.

Why with you?

It's my game.
You want the job or not?

Good morning.

Where you going?

Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

What's with all the liquor?

What's going on?
Is Bobby drinking again?

This is not for him.
This is for me.

That way, he's sober but his
shoelace stories are more amusing.

God! Even his knock is boring!

-I'll be ready in a second.
-Could I talk to you?

Sure.

This is hard for me to say.

You fell off the wagon!

Oh, no, no.

It's about you.

What about me?

I think you may have
a drinking problem.

What, these?

No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

Look, I'm not strong enough to be
in a codependent relationship.

Oh, shoot.

Well, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

Take care.

-You too.
-Goodbye.

What happened?

We kind of broke up.

Does anybody want these?

I'll take one.

Sometimes I hold stuff like this
and pretend I'm a giant.

How'd the callback go?

It was unbelievable. I walked
in there and she was all over me.

-What did you do?
-I couldn't do it.

I didn't want the part that way.

Good for you!

But wait!
I left her office...

...and she caught up with me
and offered me a bigger part.

So, and?

So, you are now looking at
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

... recurring in
at least four episodes!

All right, I gotta go shower.

I guess you guys heard
Rachel dumped me.

Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

She said I remind her
too much of somebody.

Any idea who
she's talking about?

Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

She hates him.

Hey, Julie!

How are you doing?

I don't know. It's weird
not being with Ross...

... but I guess I'm doing okay.

Actually, I've got some
of his stuff that he....

-Have we met?
-I don't think so.

You look so familiar.

May be we can talk about it
over a cup of coffee.

You know what I'm sick of coffe.
Let's go and get some juice.

all right! bye!

Okay, here's his diaper bag...

...and his Mr. Winky.

And...

... him. Hi!

-How did everything go?
-Great!

There was a projectile...

...throwing up incident,
but he started it.

We've gotta go.

Oh, right.

I've got some news.
It's about us.

You and me?

No. Susan and me.

The other "us."

We're getting married.

As in, "I now pronounce you
wife and wife" married?

We'd like you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

Why wouldn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

I just thought that

Why shouldn't I be happy for you?
What would it say about me...

...if I couldn't revel
in your joy?

And I'm reveling, baby!
Believe me!

Is your finger caught in that chair?

Want us to go?

The One With the Lesbian Wedding

This is cool.
You're actually on television.

I know.
It really hit me last night.

I'm on Days of our Lives.

Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our lives.

Yes!

What?

Carol and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

...and she's in a
full-body cast.

They want me to do it, which is cool
since I've never catered...

...and I need the money.
Is this a problem for you, isn't it?

-Would it matter?
-You're so great!

Thank you!

-You're really not going?
-I'm really not.

They already live together.
Why do they need to get married?

They love each other.

They wanna celebrate that love
with the people close to them.

If you wanna call
that a reason.

Who's the bitterest
man in the living room?

The bitterest man
in the living room?

Hi, neighbor.

-I thought you were over this.
-That has nothing to do with it.

She is my ex-wife, If she were marrying a guy,
you wouldn't expect me to go.

If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

Did I miss it?

No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himself.

She's pretty.

And she's really nice.

She taught me about
how to work with the cameras...

...and smell-the-fart acting.

-I'm sorry, what?
-Excuse me?

smell-the-fart acting

You got so many lines
to learn so fast that sometimes...

...you need a minute
to remember your next one.

So while you're thinking...

...you take this big pause
where you look all intense.

Like this....

Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

Mrs. Wallace?

Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

Is she going to be all right?

I'm afraid the situation
is much more dire than we'd expected.

Your sister's suffering from a...

...subcranial hematoma.

Perhaps we can
discuss this further over coffee.

Nice!

For a minute, I thought you were
actually smelling something.

-Do it again!
-All right!

-That was so good!
-Do it again.

"Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!"

I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

No, that's me.

Oh, right.

Oh, thanks. Couldn't....

Is everything okay?

No.

One of my clients died
on the massage table today.

Oh, my God!

That's a little more relaxed
than you want them to get.

She was, you know,

...and her name was
Mrs. Adelman.

Oh, honey.

It's just so strange. You know...

...she probably woke up
this morning and thought...

... I'll have some breakfast,
take a walk, then have my massage.

Little did she know God thought,
"Okay, but that's it."

Oh, but the weirdest things was...

... I was cleansing her aura
when it happened.

And when her spirit
left her body...

... I don't think it went very far.

What do you mean?

I think it went into me.

This is so hard.

I can't decide
between lamb or duck.

Well, lambs are scarier.

Otherwise the movie would've been 
called silence of the Ducks.

Okay, who ordered what?

I had the half-drunk cappuccino
with the lipstick on the rim.

And this with the cigarette
butt in it, is that decaf?

Oh, God.

You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

I know. I just don't want
her to think that because...

... I didn't marry Barry
my life is total crap.

Talk about crap, just
listen to Stella Neidman...

...tell her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

I'm sorry. At least you guys haven't 
need to hear staff she said in my head.

Pheebs? How long do you think
this lady will be with us?

I don't know. She obviously
has some unfinished business.

Sit up!

There she is!

-Mom!
-Hey, sweetie!

So this is where you work!

Oh, it's wonderful!

Is it a living room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

I guess that's the fun.

Pretty much.
Here, meet my friends.

Monica! You look gorgeous!

Oh, my! The last time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

This is Joey.

This is Phoebe.

This is Chandler.

You remember Ross?

Oh, hello, Ross.

Mrs. Greene.

What do you think of my
daughter, in the apron...

...with the big job!

Oh, Mom!

If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one would have anything to drink.

Believe me, sometimes that happens.

This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

I went straight from my father's house
to the sorority house...

...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

Really?

Let's make a day of it!

We will have lunch, we will shopping, 
we will get nails done, whatever you want.

Mom, I have to work.

What! No one else can pour coffee?

I know who you remind me of.

Evelyn Durmer.

That's before the lousy face-lift.
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?

I don't know.
Who's Soupy Sales?

Oh, my God!

There's an unattractive
nude man playing the cello.

Just be glad he's not playing
a smaller instrument.

You have some life here, sweetie!

Mom, I realize you and dad were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

...and get the house in the suburbs
with all the security.

This is just
so much better for me.

I do know.
You didn't love Barry, honey.

And I've never seen you this happy.

I look at you and I think,
"This is what I want."

For me.

Well, not just for you.

What do you mean?

I'm considering
leaving your father.

All right, tell me
if this is too cute.

Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

What? It's not like I'm putting
little nipples on them.

Oh! Honey, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

What can I do? You order me to make those martial art trick you used to like.

I can call it Carl Meilong to find out how?

Mom, I just don't understand. 
I thought you are happy.

So did I.

You know sometime you are driving on the highway, and you get home, and you can't actually remember you have driven there.

That's kind of my life being like.

Coundn't you listen to the radio more?

I wish it is that easy. But then I see you here and I keep thinking why can't I have this?

I want adventures, I want hang out, I want Chandler.

Believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave daddy!

You think it's something having a lot of fun, 
but it's really hard, really hard.

I got this lausy job, I barely know how to make it ramdon. 
Forget about to buying stuff.

Honey! You don't understand.
I'm be doing what you are doning, but with money.

It's very different.

-You had no idea what they getting along?
-None.

They didn't fight a lot?

No, they didn't even
talk to each other.

How was I suppose to know
they were having problems?

You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

Hey, look who's up!

I just can't believe
this is happening!

When I was little,
everybody's parents got divorced.

I figured as an grown up,
I wouldn't have to worry about it.

Can't you look at this
as flattering?

She just wants to be like you.

Well, couldn't she have just
copied my haircut?

When my parents divorced,
they sent me to a shrink...

...and she told me
that kids blame themselves.

But in your case,
it's actually kind of true.

Oh, that's him.

Damn! My mail-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

-Phoebe?
-Hi, Mr. Adelman.

-Nice to see you.
-Thanks for meeting me.

That's okay. Although you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

Do you wanna sit?

No, I spent most of my morning
trying to stand up.

What can I do
for you, my dear?

Okay, I don't know how
to say this, but....

I think when your wife's spirit
left her body...

...it kind of stuck around...

...in me.

You're saying
my wife is in you?

Yeah. You don't have to
believe me, but...

...can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

Any reason to hang around?

I don't know what to say.

All I can think of is that...

...she used to say that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

-Everything?
-Everything.

That's a lot of stuff.

Oh, wait, l....

I remember she also said she wanted
to sleep with me one last time.

I'm sorry.
There's laughing in my head.

Worth a shot, huh?

Look at this!

These are all Halloween,
three years ago.

My little matini. I love your oral of hair.

Oh, and look, here's Barry.

He came straight
from the office?

Oh, no.
That was his costume.

See, he's actually an orthodontist,
but he came as a regular dentist.

He thought that was really funny.

You guys?

Remember when I said
that I don't need your help?

Actually, I think you said...

... "Don't touch that
and get out of my kitchen."

Really? Weird.
Anyway....

I planned really well.
I planned and planned.

I just didn't plan
enough time to do it.

-You want some help?
-lf you want.

What a day!

I took her everywhere.

The Museum of Modern Art,
Rockefeller Center...

...the Statue of Liberty.

She's still with you?

Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

Such a pretty face!

Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girls!

Do you know what we should do?
Does anybody have any marijuana?

God!

Did I have to ask do we have pot.

Look, no one's smoking pot
around all this food.

Well, that's fine.

I never did it.
I just thought I might.

What's new in sex?

What's new in sex?

The only man I've been with
is your father.

I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

This is no offense to your dad,
but I was thinking...

...there might be more.

You know what? I cannot
have this conversation with you.

All right.

You come here and drop this bomb on me
before you even tell Daddy.

Do you want my blessing?
Want me to talk you out of it?

Then what do you want?

I guess I figured
you would understand.

Why on earth
would I understand this?

You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

But I married mine.

We're in trouble. We've only got

Move, move, move!

I feel like you should
have German subtitles.

Joey, speed it up!

I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

How did this happen?
I thought you had this planned out.

Do you want me to cry?

Is that what you want?

Do you wanna see me cry?

Sir, no, sir!

All right, you!

No. Look, I told you,
I am not a part of this thing.

Look, Ross. I know you have issues with
Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

But if you don't help,
I'm gonna take those hot dogs...

...and create an appetizer
called "Pigs In Ross."

All right, ball a melon!

How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to ball a melon?

-How's it going?
-Great! Right on schedule.

Got my little happy helpers.

That's fine. Whatever.

What's wrong?

Nothing.

Okay, everything.
I think we're calling off the wedding.

You're still gonna pay me, right?

Or something a little less selfish.

What's the matter?
What happened?

My parents called to say
they weren't coming.

I knew they were
having trouble with this, but...

...they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we should call it off.

She said, "This isn't for them.
It's for us."

And if I couldn't see that,
we should cancel the wedding.

I don't know what to do.

I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

You do?

Do you love her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

Of course I do.

Well then, that's it.

If George and Adelaide can't
accept that, then the hell with them.

If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

... no way that would've
stopped me.

Look, this is your wedding.

Do it.

You're right.
Of course you're right.

So we're back on?

We're back on.

You heard the woman!
Peel! Chop! Devil!

Can't believe
I lost two minutes!

It just seems so futile.

You know?
All these women, and nothing!

I feel like Superman
without my powers, you know?

I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fly.

Well, now you understand
how I feel every single day.

The world is my lesbian wedding.

Butterscotch?

No one?

All right,
you'll be sorry later.

-Thank you.
-Anytime.

Ross.

Nothing makes God happier...

...than when two people, any two people,
come together in love.

Friends, family,
we're gathered here today...

...to join Carol and Susan
in holy matrimony.

Oh, my God!

Now I've seen everything!

She's gone!

She's gone!

She's gone.

Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

Strangers in the night

Exchanging glances

Wondering in the night

Would you look at them?

Yeah. Can't help but.

How's that pig-in-the-blanket
working out for you?

I wrapped those bad boys.

I miss Rose.

Oh, yeah?

I know it's kind of weird, but
she was a big part of my life....

I don't know, I feel alone.

You know, I couldn't help
overhearing what you just said.

I think it's time you forget about Rose,
move on with your life.

How about we get you a drink?

Okay. So nice!

I shouldn't even bother
coming up with a line, right?

Hey, Mom, having fun?

Am l! I just danced
with a wonderfully large woman.

And three other girls
made eyes at me over at the buffet.

I'm not saying
it's something I wanna pursue...

... but it's nice to know
I have options.

There's more alcohol, right?

How you doing?

You did a good thing today.

You wanna dance?

No, that's fine.

Come on.

I'll let you lead.

Look, penis, schmenis!

Okay? We're all people.

Which one of us is gonna be
the first one to get married?

Mon, I was married.

-Yeah, me too, technically.
-I had a wedding.

Just trying to
start a discussion.

Which one do you think
will be the last to get married?

Isn't Ben in this?

Of course!

Absolutely.

Can't get the monkey off your back?

Then put it in your mouth...

... with Monkeyshine Beer!

Get it, monkey

Get it, get it, monkey

Monkey, monkey

Monkeyshine Beer.

Because it's a jungle out there!

That commercial always
makes me so sad.

But then the guy opens his beer
and girls run at him...

...so everything works out okay.

I meant because the monkey
reminds me of Marcel.

I can see that.

Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

I wonder if I did the right thing,
giving him away.

Ross, you had to. He was
humping everything in sight.

My Malibu Barbie will no longer
be wearing white to her wedding.

Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

...and when you got it back,
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss's hat....

Suddenly, I had this big
"attitude problem."

The One With the Super Bowl

Hey, check it out!
Guess what I got?

Rhythm?

No. My first fan mail!

"Dear Dr. Ramoray:

I love you and would do
anything to have you."

My gosh! "Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford."

Oh, wait.

"P.S. Enclosed, please find

In Crazy World, that means
you're married.

It's not addressed to Days Of Our
Lives. This came to your apartment.

She was in our building.

Oh, my God.

I got my very own stalker!

You are so lucky, I'm gonna share mine.

Joey, remember we talk about good thing and bad thing.
This is a bad thing.

Where are you off to?

There's a paleontology
conference in L.A.

So I figured I'd go and drive down
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

He will be surprised.
Till he realizes he's a monkey...

...and isn't capable of that emotion.

Phoebe? That really cute guy
is here again.

Okay, so everyone...

... pretend I'm telling you a story
and it's really funny.

So everyone just laugh. Now!

I know, I know!

I'm Rob Donan.

Hi, Rob Donan.

I don't know anything about music,
but I think you're really great.

Anyway, I schedule performers
for children's libraries.

And I was thinking, have you thought
about playing your songs for kids?

I would love to have kids...

...hear me play the songs
that I will write for them.

What do we do for dinner?

We could cook for ourselves.

It's Erika.

My God. The stalker!

Never mind. It's open.

Hitting her with a frying pan
is a good idea.

But we want a backup plan,
just in case she isn't a cartoon!

Let's get out of here!

The one time they're not home!

We'll leave.
When we pass her...

...she won't know me,
because we never met!

That's how radio stars
escape stalkers!

She's coming!

It's me.

This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

You ready?

Wait, wait, wait!

Erika!

-Mr. Geller?
-Yes, hi.

Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

You had a question?

I can't find the monkey I donated
last year. He's a capuchin...

...answers to the name Marcel?

I'm afraid I have some bad news.

Marcel has passed on.

Oh, my God. What happened?

He got sick,
and then he got sicker...

...and then he got a little better.

But then he died.

I can't believe this!

I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.
But you know, there's an old saying:

"Sometimes monkeys die."

It's not a great saying...

... but it certainly is fitting today.

-Someone should've called me.
-I'm sorry.

Look, I know this can't
bring him back...

... but here, it's just a gesture.

Zoo dollars?

Yes, and come see the bird show
at 4. The macaws wear hats.

It's a lot cuter
if your monkey hasn't just died.

I know.

I can't believe Joey's having
lunch with his stalker!

What is she like?

You remember Kathy Bates in Misery?

Well, she looks
the exact opposite of that.

And she's not crazy?

Oh, no, no.
She's a total whack-job.

She thinks that Joey is
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

Oh, my God!

And he's going out with her?

He cannot pursue this.

Just because this woman sees Joey
through the magical box...

...in her living room
doesn't mean she's not a person.

Does she not deserve happiness?
Does she not deserve love?

Why are you looking at me? He's
the one who wants to boff the maniac!

Are you okay?

No. I'm just nervous.

Maybe if I just picture them all
in their underwear....

That's not a good idea. That's
the reason the last guy got fired.

I'm used to playing for grownups.

Grownups drink their coffee
and do their grownup thing.

And kids...

...Iisten.

It's just a huge responsibility.

What?

Are you gonna kiss me?

I was thinking about it.

Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!

Ok! Let's find some seats.

Chandle, we gonna find our seats.

Hold on a second.

He thinks he can.

He thinks he can.

Oh, what the hell.

He can.

-Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
-Hi, Phoebe!

I'm gonna play some songs
about grandparents, okay?

Now Grandma's a person
Who everyone likes

She bought you a train
And a bright shiny bike

But lately she hasn't
Been coming to dinner

And last time you saw her
She looked so much thinner

Now your mom and your dad said
She moved to Peru

But the truth is she died
And someday you will too

I will have the great seven, and the doctor, will have the resertal.

-Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
-Yeah, it is.

What?

Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...

...and a while ago you were
reattaching Simone's spinal cord.

That was a tricky one.

In reality...

...that operation takes 10 hours.
But they only showed it for 2 minutes.

Who's "they"?

No one.

Drake, you are so talented.
Let me see those hands.

Oh, these hands,
these beautiful hands.

I could just eat them.

But I won't.

Otherwise my watch would fall off.

No, seriously.

These hands...

...these miracle, magical,
life-giving hands.

Just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even lick one?

All right. Just one.

You're good at that.

Oh, my God! Someone!
He's choking!

Is anyone here a doctor?

Yes, the best doctor in Salem!

Dr. Drake Ramoray!

Meet me in the nocturnal
house in 15 minutes.

Hey, look. I don't really enjoy
being with other men that way.

But, zoo dollars?

It's about your monkey!

It's alive.

I don't understand.
Why didn't you help that man?

Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

...and that was clearly a case of...

... "foodal chokage."

I gotta tell you something

You don't have to tell me anything.

You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

Who am I to question
the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?

I should be happy to be near you.

Hey, l

Hey what?

That's it. Just hey!

Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

There'll be times when you get older

When you'll want to sleep with people

Just to make them like you
But don't!

'Cause...

... that's another thing...

... that you don't wanna do
Everybody!

That's another thing
That you don't wanna do

-Excellent!
-Very informative!

Not at all inappropriate!

Thank you for coming, everybody!
There are cookies in the back.

That was great.

The kids loved you.

Yea! I rock!

And you know why?
Because you told the truth.

Nobody ever tells kids the truth.

You were incredible!

But...?

-How'd you know there was a "but"?
-I sense these things.

It was either "but" or "butter."

The thing is, I think
some of the parents...

...they were hoping that...

...you'd play more songs
about barnyard animals.

I can do that.

Really?

Because that would be fantastic!

What? You wanna kiss me?

I'm thinking about it.

So by the libery car carticuler, we still have some time.

What, I'm unemploy.

The bat.

Ambassador of darkness.

Flitting out of his cave
like a winged messenger.

Sightless specter of the macabre.

Buddy, my monkey?

Oh, yeah, right.

There was a break-in...

...a few months back.
Inside job.

Your monkey was taken.

The zoo told me
that my monkey was dead!

The zoo!

You believe everything
the zoo tells you?

That's the only thing
the zoo's ever told me.

Of course they'll say that!
They don't want the bad publicity.

It's all a great big cover-up.

Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

That guy Lipson?

Lipson knows?

-Do you have idea who else knows?
-I only know Lipson.

Lipson knows, huh?

Hello, Mr. Possum.

Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

-Taunting gravity
-Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?

Word on the street

When I say "street," I mean those
pretend streets here at the zoo.

Of course.

Your monkey found a new career...

...in the entertainment field.
That's all I know.

This is unbelievable!

So what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

Maybe.

But you already told me everything.

Check it out.

He actually is
the Monkeyshine monkey!

What'll you do?

I'm gonna call the beer company
and try to find him.

That's what I did
when I lost my Clydesdales.

Okay, hi again!

Hi, Phoebe!

Today, we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animals.

Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"

Then the farmer hits him
And grinds him up

And that's how we get hamburgers

Now chickens!

Only you who can save her, Drake!

Damn it! I'm a doctor.
I'm not God!

There goes my whole belief system.

It's Erika.

Quick! Shut off the TV.

I wanna see what happens!

I get Leslie out of the coma
then we make out.

How can that be?
You were kissing Sabrina!

Rachel, it's a world
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

Hey, Erika. Come in.

How did you get here so fast?
I just saw you in Salem.

Right, they choppered me in.

What's up?

You're having a little party too!

-ls she here?
-Who?

Sabrina. I know about you two!

I saw you today, kissing
in the doctor's lounge.

It's not what you think

You told me I was the only one!

All right, look.
That's it.

We shouldn't see each other anymore.

I should have told you
a long time ago...

... but I am not Drake Ramoray.

I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.
I just pretend to be a doctor.

Oh, my God! Do the people
at the hospital know?

Somebody wanna help me out here?

Oh, I know! I know!

Where am I?

University Hospital...

... where you've been
for the last 18 years.

How can you be here and there?

Because it's a TV show!

What are you getting at?

Nice girl, not great with concept.

I'm not Drake!

That's right!
He's not Drake. He's...

... Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!

Is this true?

Yes! Yes, it is true!

And I know this...

... because he pretended
to be Drake to sleep with me!

And then he told me
he would run away with me!

And he didn't!

And you left the toilet seat up,
you bastard!

Is all this true?

Yes, I'm afraid it is.

You deserve much better than me.

You deserve to be with the real Drake.
He's the one you fell in love with.

Go to Salem. Find him!

He's the guy for you!

Oh, Hans!

Hans?

Hans!

Yo, evil twin!

Right. Goodbye, Erika.

Good luck in Salem.

Take care.

I'll never forget you, Hans.

All right.
The people who threw the water!

Helping you out!

Fired?

Why?

The library board got a lot
of complaints from parents...

...about the stuff in your songs.

I can't believe this is the libery!

-I mean, books, freespeech, newspapers on sticks.
-I know.

What about the kids.

Did you tell your board that
the kids want to hear the truth?

I see.

Maybe if you just played
some regular kiddy songs?

What do you want me to be?
Like some...

...stupid, big,
like, purple dinosaur?

You don't have to be Barney.

Who's Barney?

I tracked down Marcel and get this.
He's healthy, he's happy...

...and he's in New York filming
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

You're kidding!

-This is amazing!
-I know.

I finally get a part on TV,
and the monkey's making movies.

Rachel, I'm ready.

Excuse me. Is this where the
singing lady is, who tells the truth?

I guess that's me.

She's here!

Sometimes men love women

Sometimes men love men

Then there are bisexuals

Though some just say
They're kidding themselves

This is exciting! I haven't
seen my monkey in a year.

What, you never
look down in the shower?

I'm not allowed to make one joke
in the "monkey is penis" genre?

Back up, please.

Back up. Come on.

Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?

I'm sorry.
It's a closed set.

I'm sorry, you don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

We used to live together.

And I have a time share
in the Poconos with Flipper.

There he is!

Hey! Buddy!

Marcel! Marcel!

In the jungle

The mighty jungle

The lion sleeps tonight

In the jungle
The mighty jungle

The lion sleeps tonight

Excuse me, this is a

Closed set. We know.
But we're friends with the monkey.

Good morning.

Look who I brought!

Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!

Whoa, dude. Burn!

I don't get it.

He seemed so happy
to see me yesterday.

Don't take it personal. He's under
pressure, starring in a movie and all.

How big of a star is Marcel?

In human terms? I'd say...

... Cybill Shepherd.

So you guys in the movie
or you just really paranoid?

Hey, Sal?

Jerry wants to know
if the monkey's ready.

Excuse me?

Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

-The one in the director's chair?
-Gotcha.

Pheebs, walk with me.

Why am I walking with you?

We're just going over here
so that we can get away from...

...the horrible flesh-eating virus!

For the love of God, woman,
listen to me!

Is he looking? Is he looking?

-We've got a problem.
-Tell me.

I can't do Chris' makeup.

She refuses to acknowledge
her mustache.

-ls it bad?
-lt looks like her eyebrow fell down.

Unless we convince her
to let me bleach it...

...Van Damme will be
making out with Gabe Kaplan.

I'll talk to her.

I hate actors.

Nice camouflage. For a minute there,
I almost didn't see you.

Excuse me.

Is your name Chandler?

Yes, it is.

Chandler Bing.

Do you know me or are you
just really good at this game?

I'm Susie Moss.

Fourth grade? Glasses?

I carried a box of
animal crackers like a purse?

Susie Moss!

Right! Yeah! Wow!

You look....

Great job growing up.

It's nice to see you don't still
wear the cap with the mirrors on it.

I graduated fourth grade
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

Remember the class play?

You pulled up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

Yes. Back then, I used humor
as a defense mechanism.

Thank God I don't do that anymore.

What you have been doing since childhood?

Well, I got a new belt.

I wondered!

-Oh, my God!
-What? What?

It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

I didn't know he was in
this movie. He is so hot!

You think?

The Muscles from Brussels?
Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?

Did you see Time Cop?

No. Was he any good in it?

Rachel, he totally changed time!

So why don't you go talk to him?

Go tell him he's cute.
What's the worst that could happen?

He could hear me.

-I'm doing it for you.
-Don't you dare! Don't!

Don't!

Tell him I cook!

Excuse me.

This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

... but my friend over there...

...who cooks, by the way....

She thinks you're cute.

You don't think I'm cute?

I don't know.

Do you think you're cute?

We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to tell you...

... my friend thinks you're cute.

What should I tell her?

You can tell her
I think her friend is cute.

-Makeup!
-That's me. I gotta go.

How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

Well, let's try one more.

There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

I'll be there.

And if things go well,
maybe this time...

... I'll get to see your underwear.

No one was around to hear that?

So what'd he say?

What a jerk!

I kept talking about you,
and he kept asking me out.

Naturally, you know, I said no.

Thanks, anyway.

He just kept asking...

...and asking, asking, asking....

If you want to go out
with him, you can.

Sounds like a jerk to me, but

Jean-Claude, she said yes!
I'll see you tonight!

Thank you.

Then Jean-Claude took me
to Crossroads...

...and we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

Oh, man. She's so smokin'!

She's got the greatest set of

No guys around, huh?

-Does anybody need anything?
-I'll have an espresso.

I'll get it.

If I ask you to, you'll end up
drinking it yourself.

-That is so unfair.
-I know.

Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did to her with Van Damme?

I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

Marcel's trainer will let me
have him for a couple of hours.

You're blowing me off for a monkey?

We can reschedule for Saturday.

Unless you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

Stick a fork in me...

... I am done!

Stick a fork what?

Like when you're cooking a steak.

I don't eat meat.

How do you know vegetables are done?

Well, you don't.
You eat them and you can tell.

Okay, then eat me, I'm done!

I've met the perfect woman.

We're sitting on her couch,
fooling around...

...and then she turns to me and says:

"Did you ever want to do it
in an elevator?"

What did you say?

I believe my exact words were....

How do you know if you wanna do that?

You just know.

We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

What I had planned shouldn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

But...

... here's an idea.

Have you ever worn women's underwear?

Well, yes, actually...

... but they were my Aunt Edna's.

And there were three of us in there.

I was thinking
it would be kind of sexy...

...if you wore mine tonight
at dinner.

You want me to wear your panties?

Could you?

If I was wearing your underwear...

...then what would you be wearing?

You're swell!

Got the music, got the dinner.

I made Marcel's favorite dish,
banana cake...

...with mealworm.

Candle.

What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

Hi, are you on your way over

No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

It's no big deal.

It's not like I had
anything special planned.

-You feel that?
-what?

We passed moment we should stop holding hands.

Rachel, why don't you
start talking first?

I feel that this is
totally unjustified.

She gave me the green light,
I did nothing

Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

If there's something
you'd like to share

You had no right to go out with him!

-That's the most ridiculous
-You sold me out!

-I did not!
-You absolutely

Would you let me talk!

Did you just flick me?

Well, you wouldn't let me
finish and I was

That hurt!

Quit flicking!

Stop flicking!

You flicked me first!

Let's not do this!

Happy thoughts!

Now I'm gonna kick some ass!

All right. Now, I will
let go if you both stop.

You want me to stop seeing him?

You want me to just tell him
you're seeing him instead?

Is that what you want?

That's what you want?

-Fine!
-Fine!

There we go.

If we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

Thanks for letting me tag along.

Forget about it.

How you doing there, squirmy?

I'm hanging in.

And a little out.

So assistant to the director?

That's an exciting job. You must
have a ton of responsibilities

I don't do the casting.

So what are you guys gonna eat?

How come all I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

...and licking you all over?

Because I went to an all-boys high
school, and God is making up for it?

I want you right here...

... right now.

Right now, right here?

Don't you think we're in
kind of a public place?

They do have the shrimp.

Meet me in the bathroom.

I'm going to the bathroom now.

Come on.

All right, mister.

Let's see those panties.

Alrighty.

But you know what
would be even sexier?

What?

If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

All right. Now, I would like
to see you wearing nothing but them.

Take your clothes off.

I hope you realize this means
we'll miss hearing about the specials.

Come on, hurry!

Do you want this done quick
or done right?

All right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

Somebody's been doing
his Buns of Steel video.

So you want me
to clench anything or...?

Susie?

This is for the fourth grade.

-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

What do I mean?!

I mean underpants, mister!
That's what I mean!

What? What do you mean?

My skirt...

...you lifted. IKids laughing!

I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!

That was in fourth grade!
How could you still be upset?

Call me in 20 years and tell me
if you're still upset about this.

I hope you realize you're not
getting these underpants back!

I can't believe this.

Just two weeks ago,
I was watching Sudden Death...

...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Can you beat up that guy?

-Can you beat up that guy?
-Sure.

This is so wild.

I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

Normally, I would not do it.

What made you make
the exception for me?

Rachel told me...

...you were dying to have a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

By the way, Drew has
some ground rules and....

Say you're sorry!

Say it!

No! I'm not gonna!

Say it! Say it!
Great!

Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

That is my favorite sweater!
That is my third-date sweater!

Say you're sorry.

You wanna play?
Okay, let's play.

Let's play.

What'll you do?

Give me back my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

You don't have the guts.

Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken
to tell some guy he was cute.

Stop! Stop the madness!

This is crazy!

Who can remember why
you're fighting in the first place?

Yes, that's right.

But still....

Look at your purse!

Look at your sweater!

Look at yourselves!

I'll help you fix your sweater.

I'll help you...

...throw out your purse.

I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you liked him.

I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

Joey?

Ma?

What are you doing here?
I thought you guys took off.

She took off with my clothes!

-Are you naked in there?
-Well, not exactly.

I'm wearing panties.

You always wear panties?

No, no. This is the first time.

Talk about your bad luck!

The first time you try panties and
someone walks off with your clothes.

I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

Let me see!

No! I'm not letting you
or anybody else see, ever!

All right, all right!

Someone's flossing!

Joey, some people don't like that.

Chandler's wearing panties.

What?

-Let me see!
-You don't have to see!

Hi, tushy!

One of you give me your underpants.

I'm not wearing any.

How can you not be wearing any?

I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

Look, Ross. I'll give you
$50 for your underpants.

-Can I have the milk?
-I'm almost done with it.

Keep your panties on.

And I'm in the movie!

-What happened?
-A virus victim called in sick...

...so Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney!

Marcel just finished his last scene,
if you wanna go say goodbye.

That's okay. He's probably
got parties to go to and stuff.

He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

Oh, my God!

What?

Looks like we made it

Left each other on the way...

... to another love

Looks like we made it

Or I thought so, till today

Until you were there, everywhere

And all I could taste was
Love the way we made it

Looks like we made it

I'm sorry. It has work between you and me. Or you and me.

Drew was very disapoited.

Well, bye for me too.

Okay, we will bye-bye again.

Perhaps the three of us. Just...

Are you sure, I can crush longer with my butt.

No, no, no...Impressive but no.

Bye, Marcel!

See you on the big screen.

You keep people drinking that beer.

I will miss you buddy.

I think I want to write
a song about all this.

Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

-How long you been waiting to say that?
-About 20 minutes!

Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

Cut!

Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

Cut!

Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

Mommy!

Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!

Hold on a second.

Nice.

I got you something.

What's this?

Eight hundred and twelve bucks.

Didn't Big Leon tell you?
It's a thousand...

...to have me for the whole night.

What's this for?

Well, I'm making money now.

I'm paying you back for headshots,
electric bills, all that pizza....

I love you, man.

Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.

This is a little extra something for...

...always being there for me.

Wow, I don't know what to say.

Wow, I don't know what to say.

What do you say?

I don't know.

It's a bracelet.

Isn't it? It's engraved, too.
Check it out.

"To my best bud."

Thanks, best bud.

Put it on.

Now?

No, it should be saved
for a special occasion.

No, that's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

When you put this on,
you're good to go.

I'm never being good to go, so why don't try some jewrel.

Oh, man!

You are so wearing that bracelet!

I so am!

Any idea what this will
do for your sex life?

It might slow down at first, but...

...once I'm used to the extra weight,
I'll be back on track.

The One With the Prom Video

-This all looks good.
-Great.

If I want to call for a reference
on your last job...?

That's right there, see?
The manager, Chandler Bing?

All right.

Let's see if you're as good in person
as you are on paper. Make me a salad.

A salad? I could do
something more complicated.

No, just the salad will be fine.

You got it.

Now I want you to tell me what
you're doing while you're doing it.

All right. Well,
I'm tearing the lettuce.

Is it dirty?

Oh, I'm gonna wash it.

Don't. I like it dirty.

That's your call.

So, what are you going to do next?

I thought that l'd
cut up the tomatoes.

Are they firm?

They're all right.

You sure they haven't gone bad?

You sure they're not very, very bad?

No, really, they're okay.

You gonna slice them up real nice?

I was going to do them julienne.

I'm out of here!

Hello?

Rachel's not here.
Can I take a message?

How do we spell Casey?

Is it like "at the bat"
or "and The Sunshine Band"?

Hey, who's this Casey?

Some guy she met at the movies.

What does he want with her?

I guess he wants to
do a little dance...

...you know, make a little love....

Well, pretty much get down tonight.

I don't know. I don't

I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.

Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?

I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?

Or Rachel and I should be together...

...and we should get
some kind of message service.

Hang in there.
It's gonna happen.

Now, how do you know that?

Because she's your lobster.

Oh, she's going somewhere.

It's a known fact that lobsters
fall in love and mate for life.

You know what? You can actually
see old lobster couples...

...walking around their tank,
holding claws, like....

Hey, you feeling better?

Yeah, I think that fifth shower
got the interview off me.

Do you have other possibilities?

There is the possibility
that I won't make rent.

If you want,
I can lend you money.

If I couldn't pay you back right away,
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.

Then why not borrow it
from Mom and Dad?

You feel guilty and tense
around them already.

Might as well
make some money off of them.

The man's got a point.

What is that sparkly thing?

That thing?

Yeah, it's a little flashy.

No, no.

No, no. It's not flashy.
Not for a goodfella.

Man, that is sharp! That must
have cost you quite a few doubloons.

Hi, darling.

What's this?

Some of your old stuff.

Well, sweetie,
we have a surprise for you.

We're turning your room into a gym.

Wow, that is a surprise!

Just one question.
Why not Ross's room?

We talked about that...

... but your brother had so many
science trophies, plaques, merit badges....

We didn't want to disturb them.

God forbid!

What's with you. What can you tell us.
How is your job.

My job, well!

Do I mention that I still don't have a boyfriend.

I just assume

We were so sorry to hear
about your parents splitting up.

Well, they're just separated.
You never know! We'll see.

I can't say any of us
were surprised.

They've been unhappy
ever since we've known them.

Especially after
that incident in Hawaii.

What? What incident?

No, no. I must be
thinking of someone else.

Maybe me!

Don't you have some folding to do?

Fold. You fold.

-Want a refill?
-I'm all right, thanks.

Give me a second.
I want to get this just right.

Dude, eleven o'clock,
totally hot babe checking you out.

That was really good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

I'm Gail.

I really have to be somewhere,
but it was nice meeting you.

Excellent!

He could have gotten me a VCR
or a set of golf clubs.

But no! He got me
the "woman repeller"!

The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap!

-It's not bad.
-Easy for you to say.

You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. Tcollection!

"l pity the fool that
puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!"

"l pity that fool"

Hey, man! We were just
doing some impressions.

Do your Marcel Marceau.

That's actually good.

Would you look at that guy?

How long has he
been talking to her?

I don't know. A couple of minutes.

Yeah, try doubling that.

It's like, back off, buddy!
She's a waitress, not a geisha.

I think she's okay.

Look at that!

She pushes him away
and he won't budge!

I'm gonna do something.

We'll get a condo...

... right on the mountain.
Ski in, ski out, it's great.

Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

What?

Ross Geller.

God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

What are you doing?

Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

I don't believe it!

If it works out, we'll have
something to tell the grandkids!

You sure will.

I've gotta go.

Take care.

See you later.

You're welcome.

-What?
-I was saving you.

Saving me from a pleasant
conversation with an interesting man?

From where I was

Okay, Ross, listen to me.

I am not yours to save.

But you are.

What?

You're my lobster.

Are you being
the blind-date guy again?

No, you're my lobster.

Lobsters....

In the tank, when they're old...

...they get with the
They walk around holding the claws.

In the tank!
You know, with...

...with the holding and....

Pheebs, you wanna help me
with the lobster thing?

Do the claws again.

Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?

Let's talk
What about us?

Ross, there is no "us," okay?

No! Listen to me!

I fell for you and I get clobbered.

You then fall for me
and I again get clobbered.

I'm tired of being
clobbered, you know?

It's just not worth it.

Well, but

No "but," Ross.

We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

Except that what?

No. No.

Accept that.

Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

You're getting good at that
Marcel Marceau thing.

What do you say we play some ball?
You and me, huh?

Okay, that's my bad.

If you hated the bracelet,
you should have just said so.

Doesn't the fact that I wore it...

...say how much
our friendship means to me?

But you insulted the bracelet
and you made fun of me.

Well, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

I was hoping you
wouldn't focus on that.

I am focus on this.

How we argue that

Come on, man! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

I promise, I will never
take it off my...

...wrist.

But if you want to
stay in there and be mad...

...you just, you stay in there.

You know what the

I am here, on my knees...

... holding up these couch cushions...

...as a symbol
of my sorrow and regret.

Much like they did
in biblical times.

Though you may haveth anger now....

You are gonna grab something, aren't you.

You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

I'm just saying!
It's right there!

Hey, guys.

Hi, darling.

Where is my grandson, You didn't bring him?

He's at Carol and Susan's today.

A woman in my office is a lesbian.

I'm just saying!

Jack, look! There's that house
paint commercial that cracks you up!

-Where have you been?
-Emotional hell.

Did they lend you the money?

No, I haven't asked them yet.

Come on, Monica, do it.

Hey, you guys.

Monica has some news.

So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before, but...

... I'm no longer at my job.
I had to leave it.

Why?

Because they made me.

You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

Judy, relax. This is our little
Harmonica we're talking about.

We taught her well.

-Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
-ln the bank.

So she dips into her savings.
That's what it's there for.

She's gonna be fine. Aren't you sweetie.

If you need a little extra...

...you know where to find it.

Anything larger back there?

I can't believe it!

Would you stop already?

Get out of the bitter barn
and play in the hay.

Oh, you're right.
I should play in the hay.

I just dropped $400 to replace
a bracelet I hated to begin with.

Bring on the hay!

Hey!

I've got something
that'll make you happy.

Guess what Gunther found?

Hey, now you have two!

Oh, now you have two.

What am I gonna do?

How come you have two?

This one's for you.

Get out!

No, I can't.

I know how much this means to you...

...and this is about more than jewelry.

It's about you and me
and the fact that we're "best buds."

Is this friendship?
I think so!

Check it out!
We're bracelet buddies!

That's what they'll call us!

Okay, here you go.
Pay me back whenever you like.

You have dinosaur checks?

You get your money
and you learn something.

What's wrong with that?

Nothing.

Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!

I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

Hey, Mon, what is this?

That's my bathing suit from high school.
I was a little bigger then.

I thought they used that
to cover Connecticut when it rains.

Hey, what's on this videotape?

I don't know.
Let's put it in.

Over here, Jack. Okay.

Rachel's coming up the path.

Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?

Can you get this?

Oh, my God!

What is with your nose?

They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

Okay, I was wrong. That's
what they use to cover Connecticut.

This is us getting ready
for the prom.

We don't have to watch.

Yeah, we do.

-Come on!
-It's fun!

Get a shot of Monica.

Where's Monica?

Over here, Dad!

Wait. How do you zoom out?

There she is!

Some girl ate Monica!

Shut up!
The camera adds ten pounds.

So how many cameras
are actually on you?

Oh, you look so great!

So do you! You look beautiful!

-Oops.
- What?

I think I got mayonnaise on you.

Oh, it's just the shoulder,
not my dress.

Everybody smile!

Oh, Dad, turn it off!

It is off.

It is not!
What's with the red light?

It's the off light.

Right, Ross?

Looking good, Mr. IKotter.

- You look pretty tonight.
-Oh, thanks.

- What are you doing this summer?
-I'm gonna hang out...

... work on my music.

Is my hook unhooked?
These things keep falling down.

Let me see. I don't know.

What are you gonna do...

The guys are here!

... this summer?

Work on your music?

Oh, my God!
There's Roy Gublik!

You know, Roy saw
Star Wars 317 times.

He was in the paper.

Where's Chip?
Why isn't he here yet?

He'll be here, okay?
Take a chill pill.

There.

I just told Rachel
that Roy touched my boob.

I can't go to the prom without a date.
I can't! It's too late!

If you're not going,
then I don't want to go.

Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

I have a wonderful idea.

You should take Rachel to the prom.

Doubtful.

Jack, give me that.
Talk to your son.

All right, go on.
This thing's heavy.

Your mother's right.
Take her. You can wear my tux.

She won't wanna go with me.

Of course she would!
You're a college man!

-I don't know.
- Well, come on.

Don't you wanna find out?

I can't believe
I can't go to the prom!

This is so harsh!

-Hold my board.
- Thataboy! Thataboy!

I think we've seen enough.

Let's turn it off.

Well, I'm not gonna watch.

Come on, kid. Let's go!

-My! Are you handsome!
-Let's show them!

Just a sec, Dad.

Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

Okay, Dad.

Rachel, ready or not,
here comes your knight in shining

Oh, no.

Don't wait up!

Chip!

Oh, dear!

How do I turn this off?

Press the button.

Which one? Which button? Jack!

The button! The button!

I can't believe you did that.

Yeah, well....

See? He's her lobster!

Dance with him!

Mom, I'm hungry!

Dance with your father.

I don't know any of your flashdances,
but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

All right.

-Oh, Jack!
-Oh, Judy!

All right, no peeking.

No peeking.

No peeking. No peeking!

All right, but you better be
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

All right. Open your eyes!

Sweet mother of all
that is good and pure!

Days of our Lives
picked up my option!

-Congratulations!
-I know!

Now we can watch Green Acres
the way it was meant to be seen.

So which one is mine?

Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

Not that one.

Oh, yes!

Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

Do we dare?

We dare.

The One Where Ross and Rachel...You Know

I can't believe two cows
made the ultimate sacrifice...

...so you could watch TV
with your feet up.

No, they were chair-shaped cows.

They never would have survived
in the wild.

This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

Rose Marie belongs on
a smaller screen, doesn't she?

Hi, you guys.

Hey, you.

How was your day?

You know, pretty much the usual.

Sun shining, birds chirping.

Really? Mine too.

Hey, cool! Mine too!

I gotta get to the museum.

So I'll see you tonight?

Bye, guys!

Tonight?

-What's tonight?
-Our first official date.

Our first date.

Hello?

Hi.

You're supposed to waitress for me?
My catering thing?

-Any of that trigger anything?
-Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!

This is our first date.

-Yes, but my mom got me this job.
-I can be a waitress!

Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

Really, Pheebs?
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

This can't be like your
"I can be a bear cub" thing.

I can be a waitress.
Okay, watch this.

Give me two number ones,

...one Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

It's James Bond!

-Sorry we're late.
-That's okay. Come on in.

Is Monica Geller coming?
I was told she was.

Dr. Burke, it's me.

Monica?

My God! You used to be so....

I mean, you've
You must have lost like....

You look great.

Thank you.

This is Phoebe.
She'll be helping me.

Nice to meet you.

-So how you been?
-Great. How have you been?

Obviously you know
Barbara and I split up...

...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

The head tilt?

Since the divorce,
everybody asks how I am...

...with a sympathetic head tilt.
"How you doing? You okay?"

I'm sorry.

It's fine.
Believe me, I do it too.

I always answer with the
"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."

"You're sure?"

"Yeah, I'm fine."

I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

Of course, the divorce only left
me with four CDs to change.

That's too bad.

I'll survive.

Two larges, extra cheese on both.

But listen...

...don't ring the buzzer for 19.

Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

They'll let you in, okay?

If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

Okay, thanks.

Pizza's on the way.
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

What if we have to pee?

I'll cancel the sodas.

Get back out there.
It's your party!

But they're so dull!
They're all ophthalmologists.

You're an ophthalmologist.

Because my parents wanted me to be.
I wanted to be a sheriff.

That's funny.
Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

But you stay out there!

-You see?
-I tell you what.

I'll come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebob emergency.

Better.

Oh, God, here we go.

Hey, want to see them go nuts?

Watch this.

Who needs glasses?

You are so smitten.

I am not!

Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

-You should ask him out.
-Dr. Burke?

I don't think so.
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

So? You two are
totally into each other.

He's a friend of my parents.
He's like 20 years older than me.

So you're never gonna see him again?

Not never.

I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

-Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
-Yeah, but you know...

... 27 is...

...a dangerous eye age.

They are peeking teams to play my discreption, help me.

I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm just saying it was a little...

... hard to follow.

I told you there'd be subtitles.

I know.

I just didn't want to wear
my glasses on our first date.

Monica?

It would help when I'm kissing
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

Honey, I'm just checking.

-Monica?
-Mon?

What?

I'm sorry.

It's just, when you moved
your hands down to my butt...

...it was, like, "Whoa!
Ross' hands are on my butt!"

And that's funny. Why?

Well, it's not.

I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just nervous.

I mean, it's you.

You know, it's us.

We're crossing that line.
It's sort of a big thing.

Well, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

I know, I know, I know!

I was thinking about when
they were there the last time.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Okay, look! I promise.

I won't laugh anymore.
Put your hands back there.

No, see, now I can't.

-I feel self-conscious.
-Come on, touch my butt.

Just one cheek

The moment's gone.

-I'll back up into your hands.
-That's romantic.

- Touch it.
-No.

-Oh, come on, squeeze it.
-No!

Rub it?

Oh, come on!
Would you just grab my ass?

Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

You've got a Cheeto
on your face, man.

Aren't you supposed
to be out with Rachel?

That was 14 hours ago.

We gonna set a clock on this scene.

So how'd it go?

Have you ever been, you know,
fooling around with a girl...

...and she started laughing?

But it was 1982...

...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut
was tickling her chin.

She laughed at you?

It could be worse, could be naked.

I've been wanting this
since ninth grade typing.

And I just want it to be perfect...

...and right and....

Why isn't that laser beam
cutting through the paint?

-It's the Miracle Wax!
-lt certainly is a miracle.

Hi, you guys.

Listen, I was thinking about....

Can you guys speak up?

It's harder for us to hear you
when you lower your voice.

I'm sorry about last night.
I really want to make it up to you.

There's no need to make it up

How?

Well, I was thinking
maybe a romantic dinner...

...with candles and wine.

And then maybe going
back to my place...

...for dessert.

That sounds...

... perfect?

What's this?

Would you get us a couple of beers?

I'm going to look into your eyes now.

Really?

That's my job.

All right.

Look up.

Look down.

Now, open your eyes and look down.

That's right.

Look into the light.

Now look at me.

Your eyes look good.
Those are good eyes.

Good. They feel good.

In my head.

-lt was great to see you.
-You too.

You too.

Goodbye.

Drops!

Here, they're free.

Thanks.

I better be going.

Yeah, I'll see you later.

Thanks again.

We have to get you lazy boys
out of these chairs.

You should go outside and be with
the three-dimensional people.

No. Inside good.

Outside bad.

You guys are so pathetic.

Oh, Xanadu!

She's one of us now.

We just wanted to stop by
and say good night.

Good night.

They won't even turn their heads.

All right, you guys.
I'm taking off my shirt.

She's lying.

Stop sending food to our apartment!

Why are you dressed up?

You're not the only one
with a date.

-What? You have a date? Who with?
-No one.

Come on, what's his name?

Nothing.

Come on, tell me.

All right, but I'm very excited
about this, okay?

So promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmental.

I promise. What?

-It's Richard Burke.
-Who's Richard Burke?

Dr. Burke?

You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

...should that bother me?

I love that man.
He's like a...

...a brother to Dad.

-Here we go.
-I know, I think it's great that he looks like 50.

It's insperation to a man almost retired all over the world.

He is the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

Dr. Burke is sexy?

Oh, God! Absolutely!

Damn!

It's the museum again.
Can l?

-Dr. Burke kissed me once.
-When?

When I was 7, I crashed my bike
right out in front of his house...

...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

-Oh, you are so lucky!
-I know.

Australopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that display.

No, Homo habilis was erect.
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

Well, maybe he was nervous.

Oh, look!
I can't believe this!

Homo habilis can't use tools yet,
and they've got him with clay pots?

Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

Clearly, they don't have a place to plug in.

I'm sorry this is taking so long.

It's longer than I expected.
We will have dinner.

That's okay.

Karl!

Oh, God.

-Wow! Is that Michelle?
-Yep.

I've not seen her since
high-school graduation.

Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru

Emotional.

You know, she's having another baby.

-I thought she just had one.
-No, no. Henry's almost 2.

And he's talking
and everything. Here.

The other day he told me he liked me
better than his other grandpa.

In all fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but still....

You're a grandpa.

Are we nuts here?

I don't know. Maybe.

I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pool I once peed in.

I didn't need to know that.

I guess 21 years is a lot.

I mean, hell, I'm a whole person
who can drink older than you.

So maybe we should just....

Maybe....

Wow.

This really sucks.

Yeah, it sure does.

We don't really have to decide
anything right now, do we?

No, there's no rush or anything.

-Pizza delivery!
-Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

I'm done.

Yeah, well, you know what?
So is Sorentino's.

I'm sorry.
Why don't we find someplace else?

It's late. Everything will be closed.
We'll do it another night.

No, no, we won't.

We won't?

Come on.

Okay, that's dead, right?

What are we doing?

-Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?
-Grape.

Okay, now...

...sit.

Oh, my God!

Billions of years ago,
Earth was only

Sorry.

So what are we looking at?

Well, you see that little cluster
of stars next to the big one?

That is Ursa Major.

-Really?
-No idea. It could be.

Listen, I'm sorry
I had to work tonight.

Oh, that's okay.

You were worth the wait.

And I don't just mean tonight.

You're not laughing.

This time it's not so funny.

Oh, God!

Honey?

That's okay.

What?

Oh, no. You just rolled
over the juice box.

Thank God!

Hey, you.

I can't believe I'm waking up
next to you.

I know. It is pretty unbel

We're not alone.

Is that the fire alarm?

It's not warm yet.
We still have time.

-Cool.
-Yeah, yeah. Cool!

Man, this is weird.

Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

That's what's weird?

The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

What?

The spoon!
You licked and you put.

You licked and you put.

Yeah, so?

Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

You used my toothbrush?

Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

Mine is the red one!

Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

... but we can use the same soap?

Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

The next time you shower...

...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

The One Where Joey Moves Out

Look at you fancy lads!

What's the occasion?

You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

He's having a brunch.

Ready when you are.

I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

You guys are getting tattoos?

But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

I'm getting a lily.

For my mom, because her name's Lily.

That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

-Where you getting it?
-On my shoulder.

What?

What's on your shoulder?

A chip.

I've got a big attitude problem.

-A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

Why? Why would you wanna do that?

You don't think
they're kind of cool?

No. Sorry, I don't.

Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

What if it doesn't come out right?

It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

Why is everyone staring at me?

Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

Richard's going to the party too?

He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

No, I think you should tell them.

I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said...

... "God, I hope they get together."

Shall we?

Okay, wait.

You know what?

Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

We're here!

-Hi, kids!
-The children!

-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you.

Happy birthday!

So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

So you kids take the train in?

No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

Speaking of whom...

... I hear he's got some

Finger cramp! Oh, God!

Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

Are we still on that?

You just know she's got
the lQ of a napkin.

She's probably not even pretty.

Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

Can you believe this place?

I know. This is a great apartment.

In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

Well, there's my fantasy come true.

Seriously.

We were just saying, great apartment!

Thanks. You want it?

I'm moving to a bigger place.

You should take this one.

Can you see me in a place like this?

Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

On TV.

Stop talking. Okay!

-Come on, tell us!
-ls she really 20?

I am not telling you guys anything.

Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

Dad, you really don't want to do that.

What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

Would you let it go?

I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

You got your own little speedster.

-Seriously, it's not like that.
-Tell you what.

Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could

Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

What? I'm kidding!

You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

Okay, Rach.

Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

-Well, l
-I like this lily.

It's more open
and that's like my mom.

She had a more open, giving spirit.

Foghorn Leghorn!

Blonde girl?
You're in room two.

Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.

Here we go!

You're not going.

Is this because of what Ross said?

-Well, yeah, maybe.
-I don't believe this.

Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

Come on, what is this, 1922?

What's 1922?

Just, you know, a long time ago.

When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

Do you want this tattoo?

Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross

Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

Who is the boss of you?

You?

You are the boss of you!

You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

Go!

We don't get my tatoo yet,
you know it's a little tough.

How you doing?

I'm a twinkie!

Really? I'm a hero.

This is so hard.

Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

Look, maybe we should just tell them.

Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

My parents are dead.

God, you are so lucky!

I mean
Well, you know what I mean.

Just hang in there, okay?

Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

Honey.

Seen my Harmon Kille brew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

I have no idea.

Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

-Really?
-I've never seen him this happy.

So, Jack...

...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

Of course not.

With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

Oh, Jack, stop!

Come on!

It's my birthday!

Can we drop this?

I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

You want it.

Why would I want another apartment?

I've already got
an apartment that I love.

It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

-What?
-I'm sorry.

I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

...that I don't need a roommate.

I don't need a roommate either.

I can afford to live here by myself.

I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

We didn't agree to live
together forever.

We're not Bert and Ernie.

I am awared that we are not gay parpens.

You know what?

If this is the way you feel...

...then maybe you should take it.

-That's how I feel.
-Then maybe you should take it!

Maybe I will!

-Fine with me!
-Great!

You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

...the spoons!

Whose drink can I freshen?

Almost time for cake!

Mon, are you okay?

You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

Well, I just caught the live show.

-Hey, there.
-What?

Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

Really?

-Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
-Not that I know of.

I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

That's an idea.

Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

Oh?

She never tells us anything.

Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

Is that crystal?

So who's the mystery man?

Well, he's a doctor.

A real doctor?

No, a doctor of meat.

Of course he's a real doctor.

And he's handsome.

And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

Well, that's wonderful.

Mom, it's okay.

It is, Judy.

Jack!

Could you come in here for a moment?

Now!

-Found it!
-I'll take that, Dad.

It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

I'm the twinkie.

-You're the twinkie?
-She's not a twinkie!

Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in

Oh, please! A relationship?

Yes, a relationship!

For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

Really?

Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

When did I say that?

Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, dear Jack

Happy birthday to you

It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

I know, so do l!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

Okay, let me see yours.

Let's see yours again.

We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

Oh, no!

It's gone! That's so weird.

I don't know how, where it went.

You didn't get it?

Why not?

I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

And did you know
they do this with needles?

Really? You don't say?

Because mine was licked on by kittens!

Serially, does it hurt a lot.

No, it's just like a pinch like that.

That's really hurt me, that's gonna leave a mark.

I'm sorry about what

-Yeah, me too.
-I know.

Do we need to hug?

No, we're all right.

So I got you something.

Plastic spoons!

-Great!
-Lick away, my man!

These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

What?

I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

I didn't think that was serious.

You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

Well, it was a fight...

... based on serious stuff, remember?

About how I never
lived alone or anything?

I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

...or whatever.

Well, there you go.

Hey, are you cool with this?

I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

I've never been lower or wetter.

I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

... bedroom into a game room.

Put the foosball table in there.

Why do you get to keep the table?

I did pay for half of it.

I paid for the other half.

I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

All right, you're on.

I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

Which sister?

So are you sorry that I told them?

No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

Did you get it?

-ls Ross here?
-He went out for pizza.

Okay, really quick.

That's great!

Very tasteful.

Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?

What? You didn't get one.

Okay. Well then, what is this?

What are we looking at?

That blue freckle?

That's my tattoo.

That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

I got her in the chair...

...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

Okay, hi!

For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

Oh, what a load of crap!

That is a dot!

Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

You got a tattoo?

Maybe.

But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

Well, let me see.

Well?

Well, it's really...

...sexy.

I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

...wow!

Really?

So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

I guess.

Save us some pizza.

Get it out of the corner!

Pass it! Pass it!

Stop talking to your men!

And the table is mine.

Congratulations.

You guys will still
come visit me, right?

Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

We'll be over there all the time.

Except when we are here.

I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines

Is that my bra?

-What are you doing with my bra?
-It's not what you think.

We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

Yeah, I remember.

Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

You want me to...

...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

You keep it.
You need the practice.

Thanks.

So...

... I guess this is it.

Yeah, right.

I guess so.

When am I gonna see you?

I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

Right. Yeah. Okay.

Take care.

Hey, dad. What are you doing here.

I just stop by your boyfriend to get a piece of my mind.

-And.
-And I was got a punch on the nose.

but he has the game on, so we started to watch it.

then we have time, and came to find out what for.

-but he offered me a beer, you know what?
-what?

he got on tap.

when he in this apartment, 
the damn thing is build right on his part.

did you talk about me?

oh, right, actually, we never got to you.

look, you are a big girl.
I just hope you know what you are doing.

I do. Dad, you wear the tie I got you.

Where did you get the hat?

I don't know.

So what do you think?

Casa de Joey.

-I decorated it myself.
-Get out!

Wow, Joey, this is....

-Art.
-Art it is.

Check this out!
Is it a coffee table?

Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

Hey, nice pillow.

So tell me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

Hey, excellent water, table thing.

Thanks. I love this.
But you know what?

It makes me want to pee.

Yeah, me too.
I think that's the challenge.

How come Chandler didn't come?

It's because he had
a thing with the...

...with the thing.

Right. I got it.

So why don't you show us
the rest of your casa?

The best part! Come on.

Nice toilet.

No, no, no. Behind it.

-You have a phone in here?
-That's right.

I have a phone.

In here.

Joey, promise me something.

Never call me from that phone.

The One Where Eddie Moves ln

Okay, here we go.

Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.
Someone just got the last piece.

Oh, my God!
You won't believe this!

I have just been discovered.

Wait a minute. I claimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

Anyway.

Don't freak out and say how
great this is until I'm done.

I just met this producer
of this teeny record company...

...who said that I have
a very fresh, offbeat sound...

...and she wants to do
a demo of "Smelly Cat."

Okay, I told you not to do that yet.

And she wants to do a video.

I'm not done yet, okay?

God!

If that goes well,
they may even want to make an album.

I'm done now.

If you care about me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go!

What are you doing?

I'm sorry.
My pie was in your hood.

I have to get the coffee
out of that guy's pants...

...and I'll be back
in the hospital by 7.

Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

Blow-drying what?
You have no hair.

What's going on?

Your boyfriend has been
in there for an hour!

It's like I'm living with him again.

He's here when I go to sleep and
wake up and when I want to shower.

I feel like I'm 16 again.

Well, you're not 16.
You're both adults now.

Get out, you doofus!

Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're glue.

All yours.

I hope you cleaned your hair
out of the drain.

Shut up!

Cut it out!

I've never wanted you more.

-Lui. Where is Howard?
-He went home.

He said he might stop by after a shift.

He said he tell you he don't feel so good.

Hey what time do you get off?

I'm not feel too good either.

So what do you say, boys?
Should I call him?

You know what they say:

Ask your slippers a question...

...you're going crazy.

I'm sorry I didn't make it
over there today.

That's okay.

You had a thing.

I hear the place looks great.

Forget about it.
I'm having a ball!

How's the apartment?

It's terrific.
I mean, it's a regular space-...

...-fest!

Well, great.

Yeah, I just...

...wanted to call and say hey.

Well, okay.

Was that the oven timer?

That's right, my friend.

It's time for...

...Baywatch!

Can you believe they gave
Stephanie skin cancer?

I can't believe
they made her lieutenant!

You're saying that because
you love Yasmine Bleeth.

How could anyone
not love Yasmine Bleeth?

Hey, they're running.

See, this is the
brilliance of the show.

I say always keep them running.

All the time running!

Run!

Run!

Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

But you wanted to live by yourself.

I did. I thought it'd be great.

I figured I'd have time alone
with my thoughts.

But it turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you think.

Why don't you talk to Chandler
about moving back?

You really think he'd take me?

We had a good talk last night...

...but when I moved out,
I hurt him bad.

He would definitely want you back.

I'm telling you,
there's no way he's moving back.

But we had one of the greatest talks
we ever had last night.

I mean, it was

It was like when we first
started living together.

I know you don't want
to hear this right now...

... but we've seen him
in his new place. And he's happy.

He's decorated.

Chandler, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

You'll have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

You're not...

... roommates anymore.

Okay, Phoebe.
You ready to try one?

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?

Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

Whoa! Oh, my God!

I mean, like, who was that?

They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

I thought they were just watching me.

Like at an aquarium, you know?

You are so good, hi, you are so good.

All right.

Now everyone knows everyone.
Let's try it again.

From the top.

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?

Okay, sorry.

I'm just not getting...

...that everyone gets...

... how smelly
this cat actually is.

Maybe if we could talk about this...

... because I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.

We can talk.

It's just that this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

So the cat stinks,
but you love it. Let's go.

No, there is no way
he was a velociraptor.

Look at the cranial ridge, okay?

If Dino was a velociraptor,
he'd have eaten the Flintstones.

Were you taking a nap?

I was.

Tony, can you hold on?
That's the other line.

Yeah, she's here,
but can she call you back?

Okay, thanks.

Call Joanna.

Did she leave a number?

Did you see me write one down?

I don't have her number, butt-munch.

She'll call back.
Don't be such a baby.

You're the baby.

-Get off my back.
-Get out of my face.

Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

Yeah, she's right here.
Hold on.

Tony, can I call you back?

That's my sister's boyfriend.

Give me that.

Sweetie, before I forget, did l
leave my diaphragm at your place?

Hi, Mom.

So how's the palace?

It's funny you should mention that
because I was thinking....

What's with the boxes?

Actually, I have some news.

Is that Joey guy gonna pick up
his moose hat or should I toss it?

Why don't you ask him yourself?
This is my new roommate, Eddie.

Nice to meet you.

-Likewise.
-How you doing?

I'll take that.

It's what I came for.

This is new.
Where'd you two meet?

At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

I helped him pick out a chorizo.

We got to talking. He needed
a place, and I had a spare room.

Now it's a spare room?

Well, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

...and I have it to spare.

Well, I got what I came for.

I'll see you.

Hey, Joe.

When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

Is this guy great, or what?

Yeah, he is.

I can't believe he has
a new roommate. Who is he?

Eddie. He just met him.

It'll never last.
He's just a rebound roommate.

Check it out! Check it out!

It's "Smelly Cat," the video!

Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't like it...

...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

Get out of here, cat! You stink!

Smoking!

Look at me!

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?

Smelly cat, smelly cat

It's not your fault

Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat

It's not your fault

Smelly cat, smelly cat

-Oh, my God!
-I know.

I sound amazing!

They won't take you to the vet

You're obviously not their favorite pet

Smelly cat, smelly cat

It's not your fault

I've never heard myself sing before.

I mean, except in my own head.

This is so cool!
Now I can hear what you hear!

Pretty different, huh?

I am sorry,
but I'm incredibly talented!

Smelly cat, smelly cat

It's not your fault

What's going on, man?

Eddie.

Morning.

I just came by to pick up my mail.

-Where's the mail?
-Over there on the table.

You don't keep it
on this table anymore?

Eddie likes it over there.

All right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs a la Eddie.

That's great.

What?

I thought you liked your eggs...

...with the bread with the hole
in the middle, a la me!

I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're pretty darn good.

Will you try some, there are some extra.

-No, thanks!
-All right.

Well, you guys...

... I'm out of here.

See you, pals.

See you.

-How are you two getting along?
-I couldn't be happier.

Great.

I'm happy for you.

All right, that's it!

He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs...

...with his moving the mail
and his "See you, pals."

And now there's no juice!

There's no juice for the people
who need the juice. I need the juice!

There's another carton there.

This isn't about juice anymore,
all right, man?

All right.

So what's it about?

Eggs!

Whose eggs do you like better,
his or mine?

-Well, I like both eggs equally.
-Oh, come on!

Nobody likes two eggs equally.
I wanna know which one you like better.

What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore.

You took your eggs and you left!

Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

Maybe this is not about the eggs.

Maybe it's about the chicken that lay them.

What chicken, there is no chicken.

I can't talk to you.

I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

Tough. We're watching
Predators of the Serengeti.

Would you guys stop!

It's my TV!

-Quit it!
-Bite me!

Monica keeps changing the channel.

That's great.
Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

Look, I refuse to get sucked into...

...this weird little Geller
dimension thing, okay?

So I'm gonna go take
a nice long hot bubble bath...

...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

What do we do about this?

We could tape Entertainment Tonight.

Not that!

This! Us!

Oh, my God, Ross, it's....
You're just....

Since you've been here,
you're driving me....

Mon, you've gone ultrasonic
again, all right?

I just can't stand you being here...

...all the time!

Why? Why can't you
stand me being here?

We're just having fun.

Fun? You think this is fun?

I thought we were fooling around,
like when we were kids.

I hated you when we were kids!

You hated me when we were kids?

I hated you.

I loved you in a you're-my-brother-
so-l-have-to way...

... but basically, I hated your guts.

Why did you hate me?

Because you were mean to me...

...and you teased me
and you always got your way.

That wasn't fun for you?

I can't believe you hated me.

But now I love you.

And not just because I have to.

Really?

You're just gonna have
to stop pissing me off.

I can do that.

Then I won't have to kill you.

So you wanna watch
Entertainment Tonight?.

Thanks.

You know what?

If you really wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

Listen, you are not
going to believe this...

...but that is not me
singing on the video.

How did you find out?

The record company sent this paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

...for someone else to sing for me.
That was my first clue.

What will you do?

I can't work with people
who would do this.

Sure.

I mean, this poor woman.

What woman?

The voice woman.

She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?

I have a video. Pay attention.

This voice woman, she's so talented.

But according to the producer people,
she doesn't have the right look.

She's like one of those
animals at the pound...

...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty.

Or you know, like some old dog
who's kind of like stinky and

Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"!

That song has so many levels.

Hey, Eddie.

You wanna play some foosball?

No, thanks, man.
I'm not really into sports.

Yeah, okay. All right.

Doesn't matter.
Time for Baywatch!

You like that show?

You don't?

It's just pretty people
running around on the beach.

That's the brilliance of it.

The pretty people.

And the running.

I'm gonna go read in my room
for a little while.

Okay, man.

I think of all the friends I've known

But when I dial the telephone

No one's home

All by myself

Don't wanna live

All by myself

Anymore

All by myself

I'm gonna sort off with a little song called smelly cat.

For those of you who wondering this is my real voice.

Smelly cat, smelly cat

What are they feeding you?
Everybody!

Smelly cat, smelly cat

It's not your fault

They won't take you to the vet

You're obviously not
their favorite pet

You may not be a bed of roses

And you're no friend
To those with noses

Ross, those are the only lines we have.
Back to the chorus!

-It's not fair. It's my money.
-I know, but it's what Bread wanted.

-Ok, which one is she?
-That's Bread's widow.

-Why she didn't upset?
-Because she just find out and cut the wire.

-Didn't she find out she can't define the money.
-No.

-Oh, Drake.
-I'm sorry, Amber.

It's like Brad to have
to have the last word.

Sorry I'm late.
What happened?

We wanna see the end.

I want you, Drake.

I know you do.

But we can never
be together that way.

What?

There's something I never told you.

I'm actually your half-brother.

So what happens next?

I get the medical award
for separating the Siamese twins.

Then Amber and I go to Venezuela
to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...

...where I find the world's
biggest emerald. It's really big.

But it's cursed.

So cool!

God, that is good TV!

The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies

Pheebs, play with me!

This game is grotesque!

Twenty armless guys joined
at the waist by a steel bar...

...forced to play soccer forever?

Hello? Human rights violation!

Don't feel so bad.
After playing...

...I break out the plastic women
and everybody has a good time.

Why don't you play with your roommate?

He's not a big fan of foosball.

Are we not getting along
with the new boy?

No, he's all right. He spends
most of his time in his room.

That's because you haven't
gotten to know him.

Let's remedy that, shall we?

-We don't need to.
-lt'll be fun!

What was that?

I thought it'd be fun if we had
beers and got to know each other.

All right.

Oh, good! Okay.

Oh, no! I have to go,
because I'm late for...

... my Green Eggs and Ham
discussion group.

Tonight, it's "Why he would not
eat them on a train."

-Have fun! Bye!
-That was so lame.

I know.

Okay, talk to him.

So you think that Speed Racer guy
gets a lot of tickets or...?

That's good.
So who broke up with who?

I broke up with her.

She actually thought Sean Penn
was the capital of Cambodia.

When everybody knows that
the capital of Cambodia is....

It's not Sean Penn.

I got a funny one.

My last girlfriend, Tilly.
We're eating breakfast, right?

I made these pancakes.
Like, 50 pancakes.

All of a sudden,
she turns to me and says, "Eddie...

... I don't wanna see you anymore."

It was literally like she had
reached into my chest...

... ripped out my heart
and smeared it all over my life!

There was this incredible abyss
and I'm falling.

I keep falling and
I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

That wasn't such a funny story.

And a crusty old man
Said I'll do what I can

And the rest of the rats
Played maracas

That's it! Thanks! Good night.

Phoebe's got another job, right?

Great set tonight, Pheebs.

I know.

We should get going.

We should too.
I've got patients at 8 in the morning.

You know how we always stay
at your apartment?

I thought tonight
we'd stay at my place.

I don't know.
I don't have my jammies.

You don't need them.

My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

Shut up. I'm happy.

Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

Of all the guys that Monica has
been with, and that is a lot...

...I like you the best.

Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

You hear that?

She likes me best. And apparently,
there have been a lot.

Not a lot.

Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

Phoebe's dead.

I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

He's not here right now.
I'm Chandler.

Can I take a message or....
Or a fish tank?

Thanks.

Come on in.

I'm Tilly.

I gather by that "Oh,"
he told you about me.

Yeah, your name came up...

...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very soul.

He's kind of intense.

Yes! Hey, can I ask you,
is Eddie a little...

A little what?

...bit country?

You know, a little rock and roll.

Come on in, you roomie!

Hello, Tilly.

Eddie, I just came by
to drop off your tank.

That was very thoughtful of you.

It's very thoughtful.

Well, okay then.

I'm gonna go. Bye.

So we getting a fish?

You had sex with her.

Check it out, check it out!

Soap Opera Digest!
That's one of my favorite digests!

Page 42! Page 42!

"New Doc on the Block,
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani."

Cool picture!

Oh, I look good.

Is this true? That you write
a lot of your own lines?

Well, kind of, yeah.

Remember last week
when Alex was in the accident?

The line in the script was...

... "If we don't get this woman
to a hospital, she's going to die."

But I made it, "If this woman
doesn't get to a hospital...

...she's not gonna live."

Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

Aren't you afraid the writers will be
kind of mad when they read this?

I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

But you know what?

This makes me look good,
which makes the show look good...

...which makes the writers look good.
So how could they be mad?

Makes up most of his lines.

Son of a....

Write this, jerk-weed.

I fall down an elevator shaft?

What does this mean?
I fall down an elevator shaft?

I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

They can't kill me!
I'm Francesca's long-lost son!

Right.

Could you sign?

No! No way! I'm not signing that!

I don't think that will affect
the plot of the show.

How can they do this to me?

All right, I'm just gonna go.

Sorry.

Well, it wasn't that many guys.

If you consider how many guys
there actually are...

...it's a very small percentage.

It's not that big a deal.
I was just curious.

-Good night.
-Good night, Richard.

Good luck, Mon.

Before I tell you, you tell me
how many women you've been with.

Two.

Two? Two?

How is that possible? I mean...

... have you seen you?

I mean, what can I say?

I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high-school sweetheart.

Now you. That's two.

Two it is.

Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

No, wait a minute now!

Come on, it's your turn.

Oh, come on!

You know, I don't need the
actual number. Just a ballpark.

Okay, it is definitely
less than a ballpark.

I am so glad
I'm not Monica right now.

Tell me about it.

So what's your magic number?

Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. All both of them.

Well, there's you.

Better not be doing these in order.

Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.

Barry.

Paolo.

Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

-Really?
-Oh, please!

That Paolo thing was
barely a relationship.

All it really was
was just meaningless, animal sex.

Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

I didn't sleep with
your ex-girlfriend.

That's exactly what someone
who slept with her would say.

This is nuts! Crazy!
She came over for two minutes...

...dropped off a fish tank and left!

Where's Buddy?

Buddy?

My fish, Buddy.

There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

This is unbelievable!

You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,
insult my intelligence by lying...

...then you kill my fish?
My Buddy?

I didn't kill your fish!

Look, Eddie

Would you look at what I'm doing?

Now that can't be smart.

So we're just gonna
take this guy right off you...

...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

Tangelo?

That's it? That's the giant number
you were afraid to tell me?

Well, that's not bad at all.

You had me thinking it was,
like, a fleet.

You're okay with it?

Oh, honey, I'm fine.

Okay, about that two.

What?

All right.

What about my two?

It just seems like
a really small number.

Right.

Don't you have a lot
of wild oats to sow?

Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

Honey, you are not an oat.

I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

I've only slept with women I love.

You've only slept with two people.

Right.

You know I love you too, right?

Now I do.

Ross, please listen to me.

You are so much better for me
than Paolo ever was.

You care about me, you're loving,
you make me laugh.

If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

Invite Paolo to have
a romp in the sack...

...and I'll stand in the corner
and tell knock-knock jokes!

What we have is special!
All Paolo and I ever had was

"Animal sex"?

So what are you saying?

There's nothing between us
"animal" at all?

There's not even,
like, a little animal?

Not even, like...

...chipmunk sex?

Try to hear me, okay?

I'm not gonna lie to you.

-lt was good with Paolo.
-Knock-knock.

But what you and I have
is so much better.

We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

You know? I swear.

This is the best...

... I have ever had.

Until now.

Richard told me he loved me.

-Oh, my God!
-I know!

Honey, that's great!

I know!

-I just can't find
-Top drawer.

-Hurry.
-Why? You need one too?

Found them!

There's only one.

We'll be right there.
We're just trying to decide something.

-They're trying to decide something.
-Good. Good, good.

So was your mustache
Did it used to be different?

How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?

I have a comb.

-What is that?
-A mustache comb.

Thank you.

Okay, I will do your laundry
for one month.

I will, I will, I will....

I will clean the apartment
for two months.

I'll give this to you now, if you
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

So were you in Nam?

We are both adults here.
We must got some way to solve this.

-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Gotcha.

One, two, three.

Yes!

Fine. Go have sex.

No! You have got it completely wrong!

John Savage was Deer Hunter,
no legs.

Jon Voight was Coming Home,
couldn't feel his legs.

You've got it totally the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight

-Honey?
-What?

Shall we?

It's not gonna happen.

They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

In the future, if I could see
the schedule beforehand....

So when I woke up this morning...

... he'd stolen all the insoles
out of my shoes!

Why?

He thinks I slept with his
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

Why would you kill his fish?

Because sometimes
after you sleep with someone...

...you have to kill a fish.

Chandler, honey...

... I'm sorry.

Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

Wait. He's not here yet.

He knows what happens.

I'm fine about my problem now,
by the way.

Amber...

...I'll always be there for you...

...as a friend and as your brother.

Oh, Drake.

Hard day, huh?

First the medical award, now this?

Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

Dr. Ramoray, report to
first floor Emergency stat.

Well, then...

... I guess that's me.

Anyone else need to go on the elevator?
Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

They only said you.

Oh, okay. All right.

I love you.

Yeah, whatever.

Oh, no!

Drake, look out!

-Did they just kill off Joey?
-No!

Now maybe.

Come on! Open up!
We want to talk to you!

I don't feel like talking!

Come on! We care about you.

-We're worried about you.
-And some of us really have to pee!

I'm sorry, Joey.

Listen, sorry about your death.
That really sucks.

-We came over as soon as we saw.
-How could you not tell us?

I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one would ever find out.

Well, maybe they could find
a way to bring you back.

They said that when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...

...that the only doctor
who could've saved me was me.

It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

But Joey, you're gonna be fine.

You don't need that show.
It was just a dumb soap opera.

This was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

Here's Monica.
She'll have something nice to say.

I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get mildew.

What? To me, that's nice.

It'll be okay. You know that.

No, I don't.

It's like you work
your whole life for something...

...and you think
that when you get it...

...it'll never be
as good as you thought.

But this so was.

It changed everything.

Like, the other day,
I got this credit card application...

...and I was pre-approved!

I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my life!

I'm sorry, man.

I don't know if this'll mean
anything to you...

... but you'll always be
pre-approved with us.

That means nothing to me.

Pecan sandy? Just made them.

Yeah, all right.

Are these raisins?

Sure, why not?

Listen, Eddie.

I've been thinking about
our living situation.

Why are you smiling?

I got a little surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

I named him...

... Chandler, you know, after you.

Well, that's not even a real fish.

No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

So what's your point, man?

Okay, good night.

You big freak of nature!

-Brisk tonight.
-Oh, man.

-Let's never speak of this.
-You got it.

Hey, Eddie.

-What are you doing here?
-Watching you sleep.

Why?

It makes me feel peaceful.

Please.

I can't sleep now!

You want me to sing?

That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

What are you talking about?

Hannibal Lecter?

Better roommate than you.

I don't think you're being fair! One
night you see me and you get scared.

What about the other nights
when you don't see me?

Last night you went
and got some water...

...and I was nice enough
to hide behind the door.

I didn't realize that.

Get out now!

You really want me out?

Yes, please.

Then I want to hear you say
you want me out.

I want you out.

I want to hear it from your lips.

Where'd you hear it before?

All right. You know what?
Consider me gone.

I will go to my brother's basement.
When he find out, I will find another man's house.

I'll be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

-Thank you.
-I heard that.

The One Where Eddie Won't Go

Well, look at you!

Finally got that
time machine working, huh?

You like it?

This guy was selling them
on 8th Avenue and I thought...

... "You know what I don't have?"

A mirror?

Fine, make fun.
I think it's jaunty.

For a guy who's recently lost his job,
you're in a good mood.

I'll be all right.
I'm not starting from square one.

I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on Days of our Lives.

That's got to have some kind of cachet.

Cachet? Jaunty?

Chandler gave me
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

I'm gonna get some coffee.

Go on, you know you want to.

So? Did you read the book?

Oh, my God.
It was incredible!

Didn't it, like,
totally speak to you?

What book is this?

You have to read this book.
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

But there's wind.

And the wind can make us goddesses.

Do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

Men just take our wind?

All the time. Because they
are the lightning-bearers.

That sounds kind of cool.
It's like The Hobbit.

It is nothing like The Hobbit.

It's like reading about
every relationship I've ever had.

Except for Richard.

Richard would never steal your wind.

Because he's yummy.

But all the others.

And the part about how
they're always drinking...

...from our pool of inner power.

But God forbid we should take a sip.

Anybody want a cruller?

This is a typical
lightning-bearer thing.

It's like...

... "Hello. Who wants one of
my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"

Don't worry about it, already!
Things happen.

You're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

Look at me.

Look at me!

Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

Can we get back to me?

Look, honey. People get fired
left and right in this business.

I already got you an audition
for Another World.

All right!

"Cab Driver Number 2"?

You're welcome.

But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

How can I go from being
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

Things change. Roll with them.

But this is a two-line part!

It's like taking a step backwards.

I'm not gonna do this.

I'm gonna tell you the same thing
I told Al Minza...

...and his pyramid of dogs.

Take any job you can get,
and don't make on the floor.

I'm sorry.

I'll see you.

God!

Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so....

Isn't it?

This is like reading
about my own life!

This book could have been called
Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!

It wouldn't have sold
a million copies...

...but it would've made
a nice gift for you.

Sweetie, we've got to go.

No! Why do we always have to do
everything according to your timetable?

Actually, it's the movie theater
that has the timetable.

It's so you don't miss the beginning.

This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you stealing my wind.

You go, girl!

I can't pull that off, can l?

Excuse me, your wind?

Yes, my wind.

How do you expect me to grow
if you won't let me blow?

You know I don't...

... have a problem with that.

I just really need to be
with myself right now.

I'm sorry.

You're right.
I don't have to apologize.

Sorry. Damn it!

-What is it?
-I don't know.

It's got all this stuff
about wind and trees...

...and some sacred pool.

I don't really get it.
But she's pretty upset about it.

This is why I don't date
women who read.

What's that?

It's my VlSA bill.

Envelope one of two.

-That can't be good.
-Open it, open it.

Oh, my God!

Look at this!
How did I spend so much money?

That's just the minimum amount.
That's your total.

Thirty-five hundred dollars
at "Porcelain Safari"?

My animals.

The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

I don't know what to do!

You can start by driving a cab
on Another World.

-What?
-That audition?

That's a two-line part!

Joey, you owe $1100
at "I Love Lucite."

-So what?
-So suck it up, man.

It's a job. It's money.

I don't need you getting judgmental
and condescending and pedantic.

Toilet paper?

I'm not being any of those things.
I'm being realistic.

You're supposed to be my friend!

I am your friend.

Then tell me things like,
"You'll be fine."

And "Something big's gonna
come along. I know it!"

But I don't know it.

What I do know is you owe $2300
at "lsn't It Chromantic?"

I'm aware of what I owe.

Then get some sense.
It took you 10 years to get that job.

-How long till you get another?
-I don't want to hear this!

I'm just saying....

Well, don't "just say"!

Maybe I should just go.

I'll see you later.

Just think about it.

I don't need to think about it!

I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

That was huge!

Big things are gonna happen!
You'll see!

Ross!

You still there?

What are you still doing here?

Just some basic dehydrating
of fruits and vegetables.

Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

Aren't you forgetting anything?

Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.

He's feistier than the last one.

Maybe because the last one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

Eddie, isn't there something
you're supposed to be doing now?

Not unless it's got something
to do with dehydrating.

Because right now,
I'm a dehydrating maniac!

I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got

You know what that is?

Your last roommate's kidney?

That's a tomato.

This one definitely goes
in the display.

Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a lemonade to go.

Lemonade?

You okay, man?

It's career stuff.

They killed off
my character on the show.

That's too bad.
How'd they do it?

I fell down an elevator shaft.

That sucks.

I was buried in an avalanche.

What?

I used to be Brice
on All My Children.

Why must everybody watch me sleep?

There'll be no more
watching me sleep! No more...

...watching!

I got some great stuff to dehydrate.
Grapes, apricots.

I thought it'd be cool to see
what happens with these water balloons.

Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!

-What?
-You! Move out!

Take your fruit!
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

You want me to move out?

I gotta tell you, that's kind of
out of the blue, don't you think?

This is not out of the blue!

This is smack-dab
in the middle of the blue!

Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

You don't have to tell me twice.

Someone will be by for my stuff.

If you think I'm leaving you
alone with my fish, you're insane!

You want some help?

No help required, chico!

All the way to the airport, huh?
You know, that's over 30 miles.

That's gonna cost you about so bucks.

Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.

Five-O dollars.

You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

When I was on Days of our Lives
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

...they'd send over
the whole script on real paper.

That's great.

If you wanted to expand this scene,
like have the cab crash...

... I could attend to the victims...

... because I have a background
in medical acting.

Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.

Don't thank me for coming in.
At least let me finish.

We could take the expressway...

... but this time of day
you're better off taking the budge.

You were going for bridge there,
weren't you?

I'll have a good day.

Honey, I know you didn't mean to.

Rach, hang up. You are suppose to be taking goddness quiz.

You should lose 100 point just because of 
you call your boyfriend in the middle of it.

Question number 28.

"Have you ever allowed
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"

I would have to say no.

And I would have to say....

What?

Do you not remember the puppet guy?

You totally let him wash his feet
in the pool of your inner power.

And his puppet too!

Well, at least
I didn't let some guy...

...into the forest of my righteous
truth on the first date!

-Who?
-Paul!

Moving on, moving on.
Next question.

Okay, number 29.

"Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

...for a lightning-bearer?"
Okay, number 30.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

Not to my recollection.

Danny Arshack, ninth grade.

You know the bottle
was pointing at me.

Only because you took up
half the circle!

Listen to you two.
It's so sad.

Looks like I'll be going to
the goddess meetings alone.

Not when they find out
you slept with Jason Hurley...

...an hour after
he broke up with Monica.

One hour?

You are such a leaf blower!

-That is not on the book.
-No, but that's what you are.

Be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.
Judas is a little loose.

Oh, my God! What's going on?

They're taking all my stuff back.
I guess you were right.

No, I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to tell you.

I was totally hung up
on my own stuff the other day.

No, listen. I need the whole
security thing, you know?

To know where my next paycheck is
coming from. But you don't need that.

And that's amazing to me.

I could never do what you do.

-Thanks.
-You hold out for something bigger.

I can't tell you
how much respect I have...

...for you not going
to that stupid audition.

-I went.
-Great! How did it go?

-I didn't get it.
-Good for you!

You're living the dream!

All right, then!

Not my parrot.

I can't watch this.

Hey, hold on, hold on.

How much for the....
How much to save the bird?

-Twelve hundred.
-Dollars?

You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?

It was an impulse buy.
Near the register.

Go ahead with the bird.

Do you have anything for around $200?

The dog.

I'll take it.

My gift to you, man.

Thanks, Ross!

I really liked that bird, though.

But the dog!

Here are your cakes.

We didn't order cake.

No, I know. They're from me.

You guys, this is not good.

We have enough trouble
with guys stealing our wind...

...without taking it from each other.

You're right.

I love you goddesses.

I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

-Thank you. So are we good?
-We're good.

We're good?

Let me take these back.
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

Are you sure this time?

I actually saw him leave.

That guy is holding a human head.

He's holding a human head!

Check it out, man!

I tore it off a mannequin
in the alley behind Macy's.

There's no alley behind Macy's.

So I got it in the junior miss
department. Big diff.

It'll make a hell of a conversation
piece at our next cocktail party.

"Our next cocktail party"?

We'll put chips in it.
We'll make it a chip chick.

Do you remember yesterday?

Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

Do you remember
talking to me yesterday?

So what happened?

We took a road trip to Las Vegas!

Oh, sweet Moses!

So on this road trip,
did you win any money?

I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cleans up!

$300! He buys me these new shoes.

Nice.

See you upstairs. See you, pals!

Is anyone else starting
to really like him?

May I help you?

Why doesn't my key work,
and what's my stuff doing downstairs?

I'm sorry.

Have we met?

It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

I'm sorry...

... I already have a roommate.

He's lived here for years.
I don't know what you're talking about.

No, he moved out and I moved in.

Well, I think we'd remember
something like that.

I know I would.

That's a good point.

Okay, wow.

I guess I got the wrong apartment.

-I'm terribly sorry.
-Hey, no problem.

See you.

Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

-You want me to help you unpack?
-Nah, I'm okay.

Just so you know, I'm not
moving back in because I have to.

I mean, I do have to, but....

It's just that that place,
it wasn't really....

I mean, this is....

Welcome home, man.

-A little foos?
-Absolutely!

What happened to the foosball?

It's a cantaloupe.

Are we gonna bring this out
every time Ross comes over?

He paid a lot of money for it.

I'm gonna hold him a different way.

If you hated it so much,
why'd you buy it in the first place?

Well, I had a whole ceramic
zoo thing going over there.

But without the other ones,
it looks tacky.

Is he housetrained or will he leave
little bathroom tiles all over?

Stay.

Stay!

Good fake dog.

-What you guys doing?
-Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

-What?
-What are you talking about?

Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

Frontier fun!

Pheebs, what about the end?

When Yeller saves the family
and everyone's happy?

That's not the end.

That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

What about when he has rabies?

He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

That's what my mom said.

I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

Why? What's about to happen?

I've never seen this part.

Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

Oh, no.

No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

No! The end! The end!

Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

The One Where Old Yeller Dies

Have you guys eaten? Richard and l
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

Chicken and potatoes.

What am I wearing?

Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

That teach me a lesson.

I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

How do you find clothes that fit?

Hey, Monica? We got a question.

All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

And no, I don't look.

No, not that one.

We're figuring out who to bring
to the Nicks game.

Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

Why don't you ask Richard?

Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Nicks game...

...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

Being a huge Nicks fan myself...

... I think you should take someone
who's a huge Nicks fan.

That's Eric.

Glad to be of help.
Matches.

I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

What?

-I don't know.
-Come on!

He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

Richard's really nice.
We just don't know him really well.

Plus, he's old

er than some people.

But younger than some buildings.

So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

He's important to me.

If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

How do we say yes...

...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

Okay, this could be tough.

We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

You almost had it.

No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

Hi, honey.

You are not gonna believe
what happened!

We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

...and he pulls himself up!

He pulled himself up!

Standing man!

I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

We know. He already did it last week.

You can watch our tape if you want.

See, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

Does he have a favorite liqueur?

He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

Listen. I feel

That would be great.

Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

Did you just see that?

Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

He's never waved before!

Yes, he has. Very good.

What you got there?

Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

All you need now is The Killing Fields
and guacamole, and you got a party!

I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

You know, before she killed herself.

Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

What's the matter?
He's parking the car.

-Did you guys have fun?
-Your boyfriend is so cool.

He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

He must like you best.

What about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

You never even saw the money.

Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

You're welcome. Hey, Joey,
thanks for parking the car.

No problem.

-Hey, Chandler
-I think they get it.

There's the man!

Hey, you're getting better.

I'm gonna keep this.

He kept my dollar.

Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

We're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

Look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

-We love you.
-Bye, Mommy.

Have a good time.

Look.

Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

Not like him, per se.

Just not unlike him.

It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

I'm just trying something here,
you know?

Why didn't you grow a mustache?

We flipped for it.

I got the cigar,he got the mustache.

If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

You really sidestepped
that land mine.

I promised Richard
we'd meet him downstairs.

You're meeting Richard?

-Ranger game.
-Didn't he tell you?

He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

You hear that?

We're the guys!

With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

Thank you!

Hi. We're visiting.

It's Ben and his dada.

Can you say "dada"?

I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

No luck, huh?

A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but....

Would you hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

Sure. Okay.

What are you doing?

I'm holding Ben.

He's a baby, not a bomb.

Hold him like you'd hold a football.

This is how I would hold a football.

Here. Here. There we go.

Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

I mean, you know, since I was one.

-It's all right. No big deal.
-Really?

I'm sure you'll feel different
when it's our baby.

-What?
-What?

You think about stuff like that?

Yeah. I mean....

Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

Two babies?

You know, a boy and a girl.

Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

Then what's gonna happen?

We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

... but close enough
that they can baby-sit.

And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

... but the school system's great.

Wow, that's great! Great!

Okay, wow! You know what?

I'm off my break now.

Here. You take this.

I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

Look at that. I don't have a pot.

I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating
each other in the Andes.

I was really just need a small talk.

Ok, I was just fanting.

So you watched the movies?

What is happening to the world?

I mean....
No, no, because E.T. Ieaves...

...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

Charlotte who?

With the web. The spider.

She dies. She has babies and dies.

It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

You wanna feel better?

Here. Watch this.

It's a Wonderful Life.
I've heard of this.

So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

Wonderfulness is baked right in.

I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

Hey, big guy. Game time.

-Hey! Be right there!
-There's a game?

I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

Bring your nerves of steel.

It's the basketball playoffs.

I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

They have each other.

Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

They don't start sentences with
"You know who just died shoveling snow?"

All right, that's great.
Then just go.

Go Nicks!

It's the college playoffs.

-Then, go Vassar!
-They're not in it.

Okay, then just go.

Why does this bother me so much?

I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

Sure.

He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

Me too!

Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys

Ross made plans for the century.

I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

What happened back there?

I don't know. You tell me.

One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

... I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

You never think about our future?

I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

I do not think about
our children's names!

You know what our
children's names will be?

No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

And I thought that might be good.

What book?

The Big Book of Children's Names.

Okay, listen.

What we have is amazing.

But I do not want
everything decided for me!

I spent my whole life like that.

It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

I like not knowing right now.

Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

-Okay, fine!
-Thank you!

-We're not done!
-I didn't know that.

You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

He knows we'll end up together.

If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

-I will!
-Good, because I love you!

Oh, yeah? I love you too!

-That's the first time we've said that!
-Yes, it is!

-I'm gonna kiss you!
-You better!

Thanks for the great movie tip.

-Did you like it?
-Oh, yeah.

I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

IKick, save! And...

...denied!

He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up....

Yes!

Could that shot be any prettier?

Man, you are incredible.

We had a table in college.

Really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

One more point.

Score!

Now can we go?

That's why we don't let her play.

Is everything all right?

Don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

He's just really great
to hang out with.

-Well....
-No, seriously.

We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just

What are you kicking me for?

I'm trying to talk here.

You guys see me as a dad?

-Oh, yeah!
-No!

You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

We mean "pal."

No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

Monica's my dad.

I've even got some dads down at work.

That's fine.

Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

I'll just see you kids around.

Nighty-night.

You're not a dad!

I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

So are you okay?

Just...

... I feel like I'm about a hundred.

I thought I was just one of the guys.

Come here.

I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

I was killing them.

Yeah, well they suck too.

You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

-It's us.
-Come on up.

I'll get his stuff together.

Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

Yes, we can.

Yes, we can.

There! I did it!

I did it!

Look at that!

It stays on and everything.

I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

-What?
-Ben just said hi!

What, the word "hi"?

No, my Uncle Hi.

Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

-Where is he?
-We missed you.

We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

What did he say?

Something about hi.

That's so exciting!
Mommy's so proud of you!

You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

This could go on for a while.

You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

Well, this was fun.

We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

-All right, so I've got him...?
-Tuesday.

Bye, you guys.

-Take care.
-Bye, Ben.

Did he just say "bye"?

He said bye!

You said bye!
He said bye to me!

Yes, he did!

Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

See you later.

Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

...isn't this a nice hole here?

Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

But I think we can handle it.

And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so....

Here we go.

Bert? Bert?

What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

I'm so glad you're here.

Why are we watching
the Business Channel?

Because the other day I saw there was
a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.

Sometimes it takes two or three hours
before it comes up again.

But when it does, it's exciting.

Okay, honey, you really need a job.

Dad says he knows someone
you can call for an interview.

Right there! That's the third
sign today. Right there.

On behalf of everyone,
I'd just like to say, "Huh?"

No, you just said "dad."
And everywhere I go today...

... I keep getting signs
telling me to go see my father.

Like when I was walking over here
and I passed a buffet.

Which is my father's last name.

And they were serving franks...

...which is his first name
minus the "s" at the end.

And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning chicken.

His lndian name?

No. Because I chickened out
the last time...

...when I tried to meet him.
So coincidences? I don't think so.

-Very freaky.
-Eerie.

Who wants the last hamburger?

That's it.
Now I have to go see him.

Why?

Hamburger? McDonald's?

Old McDonald had a farm.
My dad is a pharmacist.

And ei ei oh, 
It's what your mom said when you father left you.

Yes! really? No!

The One With the Bullies

Man, I am so beat.

You wanna forget racquetball
and hang out?

Yeah, all right.

-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Sorry, we didn't know.

We were sitting there.

Okay.
There is one more way to say it.

Who knows it?

-Was that supposed to be funny?
-Actually, I was going for colorful.

-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

Nothing. Nothing's with him.

Enjoy your coffee.

What just happened?

I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

My joke is that I took your hat.

That is funny.

Can I have it back?

You know what?
I think you're very funny.

Kudos on that hat joke.

But come on, guys,
just give him back the hat.

Why should we?

Because it's a special hat.

He bought it because
he was feeling down one day.

So he got the hat...

...to cheer himself up, you know?

-Chandler
-Stop talking. Stop talking now.

Let me get this straight.
You're stealing my hat?

You got a problem?

I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

I'm telling you Rach, 
I've gone dead hunting with Phabby before.

It's a very scary thing for her, 
and she is very vunlerable.

That's why we are there. 
You know, be supported or crap.

Ok, will you just let me know when to do witch.

How'd the interview go?

It bit.

It was a 50s theme restaurant.

I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

I was a sous chef
at Cafe des Artistes.

How can I take a job where I have
to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?

-Don't do it.
-How can I not do it?

I have $127 in the bank!

Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

I don't want a beer.

Who said it was for you?

What's the matter?

Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

-No!
-You're kidding?

It was ridiculous.
These guys were bullies.

Actual bullies.

We're grownups. This kind of stuff
isn't supposed to happen anymore.

Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

Forget it. It's probably stripped
and sold for parts by now.

-I went up!
-What?

My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

Do you realize that if I'd invested
my $127 in myself yesterday...

...that l'd, like, have
a lot more than that today.

You know what?
I'm going to do it.

-Do what?
-Put all my money in me.

You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

What's to know?
Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.

Yes, Manhattan.

Telephone number for the stock...

...selling store.

See? I told you these pillows
would be a good idea.

Oh, God.

Here we go.

For the first time in my life,
I'm gonna say, "Hi, Birth Father!"

-We love you. We're here for you.
-Good luck.

Thanks.

Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

What is in that?

Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

No, because mayo,
that would make it gross.

-Run, Phoebe, run!
-No, no, doggy, please!

I do so want to love all animals.
Please, no. Back off!

-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

Look, kibbles! Bits!

Get the hell off my leg,
you yippity piece of crap!

Okay. All right. We have a problem.

Why don't you take his trampoline?

Okay, here, I know what we can do.

Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

The dog will lick himself
but he will not touch your sandwich.

What does that tell you?

-lf he's not going to eat it, I will.
-Are you crazy?

He's just a little dog.

-Hey.
-What?

Do you have to be a Century 21
real-estate agent...

...to get to wear those cool jackets?

Do you say this stuff to girls?

Isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

And look where they're sitting.

You're joking, right?
You guys just walked through the door.

Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

This couch belongs to us.

I'll tell you what,
you call the couch...

...and then we'll call the couch...

...and we'll see who it comes to.

You know what I don't like you.
You always got something to say.

You know, I keep wondering
why you two are still sitting here.

All right, that's it.

I have had enough of this.

Gunther.

These guys are trying
to take our seat.

Fellas, these guys were here first.

Oh, sorry, didn't realize.

There you go.

Thank you, Gunther.

We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

He told on us?

You told on us?

Well, pal, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

-Don't play with his thing.
-I know.

All right.

Let's take this outside.

"Let's take this outside?"

Who talks like that?

The guy who's about to kick your ass
talks like that.

You had to ask.

Okay, okay, look. See...

...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

Here's the deal.

You won't have to, so long as you
never ever show your faces here again.

I think you played
the Gunther card too soon.

Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

Yeah, I don't know.

What's the matter?

I just think that this was
a really bad sign.

Like the beast at the threshold.

It's just I have no family left,
except for my grandmother.

But let's face it, she's not
gonna be around forever.

Despite what she says.

And I have a sister who I've barely
spoken to since we shared a womb.

I don't know. This is my real father...

...and I want things to be,
like, just right.

I completely understand.

Whatever you need.

Hey, you want to go home?

Okay, thanks. Sorry, again.

What was that?

I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

I want to buy five shares of SGJ.
Now.

Come on, time is money, my friend!

Thank you!

"Time is money, my friend?"

You missed "Takes money to make money"...

...and "Don't make me come down there
and kick your Wall Street butt."

I made $ 17 before breakfast.
What have you done?

I had breakfast here,
so technically I saved $3.50.

How did you make $17?

Well, my financially
challenged friends...

...I split my money and I bought
some shares of CHP and ZXY.

How come those?

Well, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

And ZXY because I think
it sounds "zexy."

What happened to MEG?

MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

My motto is, "Get out
before they go down."

That is so not my motto.

How's the dog?

Okay. I talked to the vet.
People are so nice upstate.

He said the little fella's gonna be
okay, and I can get him tomorrow.

-Good.
-Thank God.

But he did have to have
a bunch of stitches.

And he said that only once in a blue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

So still hoping.

Now are you going to call your dad
to let him know that his dog is okay?

I don't want to meet my father
over the phone.

What will I say,
"Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.

Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."

Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

Listen, just don't say anything
about me, okay?

Don't...

... be too long with the phone.

She'll be a much better friend
once the market closes.

It's a woman.

So talk to her.

Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

I know where your dog is.

I want you to know he'll be returned
to you almost as good as new...

...within 24 hours.

Goodbye.

-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

Your cappuccino, sir.

Thank you.

-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-Absolutely.

How come it's not mixing
with the water?

The package says to keep it moving.

Stir and drink, never let it settle.

This is ridiculous.

After I get back from
my niece's christening...

...I'll go to the coffeehouse with you
and we'll have a cup of coffee.

No problem. Joey's there.

I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a "k."

I say you and I go
and stand up to those guys.

All right, hang on
a second there, Custer.

Ross, have you ever
been beaten up before?

Yeah, sure.

By someone besides Monica?

So what?

So we get beaten up. Maybe that's
something a man has to go through.

Like a rite of passage or something.

Couldn't we just lose
our virginities again?

Because I think actually
mine's growing back.

Are you go with me or not. Come on.

All right, I'm go with you.
Just prepare clean underware for the hospital.

-I need $100.
-What?

Welcome home.

-I need $100.
-For what?

-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

I lost it all. I lost it.

I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

Where are we on the $100?

I don't have it.

But I need it!

Otherwise, I'll have to
take that diner job.

You know, with the dancing
and the costumes.

I don't want to have to wear
flame-retardant boobs.

Nobody does, honey.

Noodle!

Oh, my God. What the hell
happened to my dog?

It was an accident.

And the woman who did this
would never hurt a dog on purpose.

She's a vegetarian.

Are these stitches?

Yeah, eight of them.
That's 56 to him.

If it's raining, you can't
let him look up...

... because that cone
will fill up fast.

Thanks for bringing back
what's left of him.

-ls Frank home?
-How do you know Frank?

Just from a long time ago.
Is he here?

What?

I mean Frank Senior.

He went out for groceries.

Will he be back soon?

He left four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

I'm gonna go.

I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything.

I'm sorry.

Hey, lady!

Hey, wait up!

-How do you know my dad?
-Well, I don't really.

Just genetically.

He's kind of my dad too.

Heavy.

So did he ever talk about me... Phoebe?

No, but he didn't really talk
about anything.

Except stilts.

-Stilts?
-Yeah, he loved stilts.

One time, I was upstairs stealing
cigarettes out of my mom's purse...

...and all of a sudden I look over...

...and there's Dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

He just had this big smile on his face
and he was waving...

...because he was happiest
when he was on his stilts.

I don't know what to do with that.

Me neither.

So are you, like, my big sister?

This is huge. You can buy me beer!

I'm not gonna.

But you know what's cool? If you had
a friend named Pete, I could say...

... "I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother."

-I got a friend named Mark.
-That'll work too.

Cool. All right.

So maybe, you know,
I could give you a call sometime.

We could talk or something.

-Yeah, that'd be okay.
-All right.

I'm in the book.

So stilts, huh?

If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

We did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

-How long does coffee take?
-Would you come on? Come on!

Thank you.

-There we go.
-I think we proved our point.

-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feel my tongue.

Bullies! Big bullies!

Look who's here.
It's the weenies.

Did we not make ourselves clear
the other day?

That's why we're here.

Yes, we're standing our ground.

Apparently.

Let's do this already.

You got a weapon?

A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

All right, let's do this.

Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

-What do you mean?
-It's sharp, it's metal.

I think I can do some
serious damage with it.

No, you can't use your watch.

Or your keys.

Here's what we'll do.

We'll put all keys and watches
in the hat over there.

All right?

All right, come on, man. Let's do it!

Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?

I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

Actually, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow...

...and this no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

Nothing from the neck up.

Or the waist down.

-Dana's ovulating.
-Really? You guys trying again?

Let me get this straight.
We're talking about the middle?

Come on!

You want a piece of this?
I'm standing here!

Those guys are taking our stuff!

God, that was amazing.
That was incredible.

-You guys kicked butt!
-Us? What about you guys?

You really gave it to
old Mr. Clean back there.

-He was a big guy.
-Yeah, he was, wasn't he?

I wouldn't know,
having missed everything.

Don't do that to yourself.

Any one of us could have tripped
over that little girl's jump rope.

So listen, guys...

...are we okay here?

We're okay.

So can I have my hat back?

Oh, my God. Look at her.

Hi, Monica!

How's it going?

Hey, nice boobs.

Guys, guys. Check this out.

Excellent.

I'll get candles and
my mom's lace tablecloth.

And since it's Rachel's birthday...

...I thought I'd poach a salmon.

What?

Question. Why do we always
have parties where you poach things?

You want to be on the food committee?

Question 2. Why do we always
have parties with committees?

Why can't we just get pizza
and beer and have fun?

I agree. Fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

And I'm not sure we are.

You don't want it to be special?

Fine. You can throw
any kind of party you want.

Joey, they're not real!

I start miles beneath the surface
of these things. They're fake.

See?
Honk, honk!

Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

The One With Two Parties

Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

I still have to invite Dylan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

No Shannon Cooper.

Why not her?

Because she....

She steals stuff.

Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept
with her and never called her back.

Joey, that is horrible.

Hey, I liked her.

Maybe too much.

I don't know.

I guess I just got scared.

I'm sorry. I didn't know.

I didn't think anyone
would buy that. Okay!

Hi, honey.
How did it go?

It was the graduation from hell.

My cousin went to hell
on a football scholarship.

It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

My sister would graduate from college.
Nobody thought she would.

It's a testament to what a girl
from Long lsland will do for a Celica.

What happened?

My parents happened.

All they had to do was sit
in the same stadium, smile...

...and not talk about the divorce.
But no!

They got into a fight
during the commencement address.

Bishop Tutu actually
had to stop and shush them.

You know the good news?

I get to serve coffee
for the next eight hours.

I guess we don't invite her parents.

-How about just her mom?
-Why her mom?

Because I already invited her.

Did you ask Stacy Roth?

Can't invite her.

She also steals.

So does her roomate.

Here are the candles.
Where's the birthday cake?

We're not having birthday cake.

We're having birthday flan.

Excuse me?

It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

That's nice.

Happy birthday, Rachel.
Here's some goo!

Dr. Greene!

Oh, my God!
It's Rachel's dad.

Why are you here?

The father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

No, no, the father can.

But since I am the roommate,
I can tell you she's not here.

And I'll pass along the message.
Okay? So bye-bye.

You're having a party.

No, no, not a party.

Just a surprise gathering
of some people Rachel knows.

-This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.
-I'll never remember all that.

So what's the deal?

Rachel comes home, people pop out
and yell stuff? Is that it?

This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

Hi, Monica.

The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

So basically, just a Chinese guy.

Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

All right.
That sounds like a two-person job.

Well, my goodness!
What was that?

Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.
We weren't ready for you yet.

-You thought I was Rachel?
-Yes, because you look so young.

And because you're both,
you know, white women.

Oh, I missed you kids.
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

-No, I'll take that for you.
-Oh, well, thank you.

Such a gentleman.
Thank you.

It all looks so nice.
So festive. All the balloons.

Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

-I was driving
-That's great!

I can't wait to hear the rest,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

Hey, come with me.

-What?
-lt will be like we're gal pals.

You know, like at a restaurant.
It'll be fun! Come on.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

Think. Think.

What would Jack and Chrissy do?

Okay, now that your coat
is safely in the bed

We can come back out
in the living room.

Joey and Chandler, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

Yes, absolutely.

Why, again?

Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

-See, this is just the staging area.
-Right, it's the staging area.

This is clearly
in the wrong apartment.

All right, you guys are off
to party number one.

And you....

You are off to party number two.

All right, let's keep it moving,
let's keep it moving.

At least send some women to my party.

Okay, that's Ross. All right.

Okay, they're coming.

Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.

Thanks for being born.

Thank you for my beautiful earrings.
They're perfect.

I love you.

Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

Now I love you even more.

Surprise!

Oh, my gosh!

Wow!

Oh, my God. Mom!

This is so great!

Happy birthday, sweetie.

You! I had no idea!

-Really?
-No, I knew.

All right.

There's food and drinks on the table.

Go across the hall.
Right now, Joey and Chandler's.

-Why?
-Just go.

Weird.

Surprise!

Happy birthday, sweet pea.

Daddy!

Both of them are here? Both of them?
Both of them are here?

Well, we could count again?

I can't believe this!

You know, this is ridiculous.

This is your birthday, your party.

Let's put them together.
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

-I do.
-That's who.

Are you gonna be okay?

I don't really have a choice.
I can look at the bright side.

I get two birthday parties
and two birthday cakes.

Well, actually...

...just one birthday flan.

It's a traditional
Mexican custard dessert.

Talk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

Some girl just walked up to me
and said, "I want you, Dennis"...

...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

I love this party!

-Quick volleyball question.
-Volleyball.

We set up a court in your room.

You didn't like
that gray lamp, did you?

A woman stuck her tongue down my throat.
I'm not even listening to you.

-Dennis!
-Okay, that's me.

Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

Stay clear of "I'm the guy
that's doing your daughter"...

...and you should be okay.

I want you to take a piece of paper

Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

... because they will dry out.

Hi, Dr. Greene.

So how's everything in the...

...vascular surgery...

...game?

It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my table today.

I'm sorry.

That's the good thing about my job.

All the dinosaurs on my table
are already dead.

Listen, I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

... but I've noticed some of you
are just placing them on.

You want to push the caps...

... until you hear them click.

Gunther!

Where you going?

I was sort of thinking about maybe

No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

We're just starting.
Here's your marker.

If you want to go, just go.

She'll yell at me again.

All right, I can get you out.

What?

In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

When I do, walk quickly to the door
and don't look back.

-I think I need a drink.
-I'll get it for you.

-What do you want?
-Scotch.

I'll be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

Neat!

Cool.

Neat, as in no rocks.

I know.

Hello, Ross!
Where have you been?

I have been in the bathroom.

Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

Scotch neat.

That's Rachel's father's drink.

Mine too. Isn't that neat?

Scotch neat.

Would you excuse me?

Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

I'm getting my cigarettes.

No.

What do you mean "no"?

See, because that's the staging area.

You go in there, it'll ruin
the whole illusion of the party.

Take your scotch back in there...

...and I will get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

-Get my glasses too.
-All righty-roo.

What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is...

... "Monica, your party sucks."

Very funny.

Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

What?

I don't see anything.

Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

Ross, whose glasses are those?

Mine.

You wear bifocals?

I have a condition apparently...

...that I require...

...two different sets of focals.

Do you know my husband
has glasses just like that?

Well, those are very popular frames.

Neil Sedaka wears them.

I hear you can get people out of here.

You didn't tell me
your boyfriend smokes.

Yeah, like a chimney.

Big smoker.

Big, big smoker.

In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway
and fire up this bad boy.

Are you wearing my glasses?

Yes.

I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

Thank you.

Is that one of my cigarettes?

Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out of here.

But it has to be now.
She'll be back any minute.

What about my friend?

Only the three of you.
Any more and she'll get suspicious.

-Let me just get my coat.
-There isn't time!

Just leave everything.

They'll take care of you next door.

Is it true they have beer?

Everything you've heard is true.

Could you guys please keep it down?

We're trying to start
a Boggle tournament.

True, if these people find out a funny game,
then will be no people left in our party.

You!

And you.

You're supposed to be at my party.

And Gunther!

What are you doing here?

Welcome to the fo

All right, I'm sorry.
But these people needed me.

They work hard all week.
It's Saturday night.

They deserve to have a little fun.
Go!

You know, my party is fun.

It's a little quieter,
less obvious sort of fun.

But if people would just
give it a chance, it's

-You want me to see a therapist?
-Sweetheart, you have a problem.

You've chosen a boyfriend
exactly like your father.

Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

Did you know your mother
spent $1200 on bonsai trees?

I felt like Gulliver.

Daddy, I really want
to hear more about this...

...but I just have to do some stuff.

You work and you work
and you work at a marriage...

... but all he cares about
is his stupid boat.

You work and you work
and you work on a boat.

He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

And you sand it and varnish it.

But when all is said and done,
he still drinks out of the mugs.

One night of her yoga
and Bridges of Madison County....

-The scotch, the cigarettes....
- The bonsais and the Chihuahua....

I may have only been in therapy
for three weeks now but

What the hell does she want
with half a boat?

Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'll be skins.

I'll be skins!

How you holding up there, big tiger?

Sorry. When my parents were getting
divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."

I got a lot of "champs,"
"chiefs," "sports."

I even got a "governor."

This is it, isn't it?
This is what my life will be like.

My mom there, my dad there.

Thanksgiving, Christmas.

She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister will decorate with wicker.

How did you get through this?

I relied on a carefully
regimented program...

...of denial...

...and wetting the bed.

You know, I just
It's so weird.

I mean, I was in there just listening
to them bitch about each other.

All I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of July.

Because it reminded you of the way...

...our forefathers used
to bitch at each other?

It's just this thing.
Every year we would...

...go out on my dad's boat
and watch the fireworks.

Mom always hated it because
the ocean air made her hair all big.

My sister Jill would be
throwing up over the side...

...and Dad would be upset
because nobody helping.

And when we did help, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

You know, and it'd get really cold.

And we'd all just sort of
smoosh under this one blanket.

It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

And now it's....

Yeah, I know.

Thanks for coming.
I hope you had fun.

All right, I'm hitting the road.

Now, I've left my 10 verbs
on the table.

Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

Okay, will do. Glad you came.

-I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
-Let me go check.

Your mom wants to say goodbye.

Happy birthday, sweetie.

You drive safe.

What are you doing?

I'm getting ready
for the water skiing.

Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on!

How are you?

-Where are you going?
-To get my coat.

We'll get that for you.

All right, all right.
I can get my own coat.

Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

This is the staging area.
It's all wrong. You should leave.

You know, just get out.

Or perhaps you'd like
a creme de menthe.

I have to be heading
toward my chateau.

I guess we're going back
into the hallway again.

Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

You take care.

Oh, you kids.

Well.

This is the best party
I've been to in years.

Thank you!

Okay, everybody,
it's time for flan!

Yep! Get ready
for the gelatinous fun.

Looks like that stuff you get
when you get an infection.

Okay, that's enough.

Okay, Rachel,
make a special flan wish.

Okay, I've got one.

Heads up!

Wow! Those things almost
never come true.

Chandler, Mon, there's only one
banana-nut muffin left.

I ordered mine first.

Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

Give it to me.

No.

Give it to me!

Okay, you can have it.

There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

That was there when I got here.

Hey, you'll never guess
who's coming to New York.

Quick, tell us before he swallows.

Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

You went out with a guy in the Navy?

I met him while playing guitar
in the park.

Ryan threw in saltwater taffy
because he didn't have change.

Is that when you wrote
"Saltwater Taffy Man"?

No, he's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every couple years...

...and we have an amazing
three days together.

Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.
Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!

So this guy goes down
for, like, two years at a time?

That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

Hi.

Oh, no. What happened?

I just spoke to Carol.
Ben's got chickenpox.

Oh, no.

Yeah, so if you haven't had it,
chances are you'll get it.

-I've had it.
-I've had it.

-Had it.
-Had it.

I've never had it. I feel so left out.
Oh, look!

The One With the Chicken Pox

Honey, you made the bed again.

I told you, you don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

Then I guess the panty raid last night
was totally uncalled for.

I'm taking a shower. Today I'll
sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."

Hey, Mon, I have a question.

Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whole damn town...

...or the fattest man?

The baddest. Otherwise, the song
would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."

What are you doing?

I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

Are you remaking the bed?

I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

Then you're redoing it
because...?

You'll think I'm crazy.

You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

Okay. You see...

...the duvet tag shouldn't be
at the top left corner...

...it should be at the
bottom right corner.

-That's not so crazy.
-I'm just easing you in.

All right.

You see these little flower blossoms?

They should be facing up not down...

...because the head of the bed
is where the sun would be.

You don't love me anymore, do you?

Actually, if it's possible,
I love you more.

Really?

Wow. Well, then, come on!

I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.

If you need something
to hold you over...

...I can get you a job here
as an entry-level processor.

Don't you need experience like this?

It's not hard to learn.

As for people realizing you don't know
what you're doing, you're an actor.

Act like a processor,
people will think you're a processor.

Here's this morning's projections.

Thanks.
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

Joey is a fellow processor.

No kidding?

I process. People want the processing,
I'm the one they call.

-Where do you work?
-Well, I'm in between things.

You know, one day you're processing,
the next day...

...you're not so much
processing anymore.

I told Joey about the opening
in Fleischman's group.

Fleischman's group.

Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

Are all you processors dorks?

This lipstick looks just great on you.

You look fabulous.
You really do.

Yeah, are you sure?
Really?

See, you look beautiful.
For God sakes, dim the lights.

I'm hideous!

It's gonna be okay.

Ryan's been underwater.

He's just gonna be glad you don't
have barnacles on your butt.

Come in.

Hey, baby, I'm back

Hey, Ryan. What's up?

What's going on?

No, no.
You have to stay back.

I have the pox!

Chicken or small?

Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

-Why aren't you home in bed?
-My grandmother's never had chickenpox.

Please tell me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

I'm sorry, I never had them.

If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and rub that kid all over my face.

Yeah, or you could wish
that I didn't have them now.

Can I please see your face?

No. You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

It could be lox, I wouldn't care.

And you hate fish.

So sweet. All right.

Okay, all right.
You can see.

This is me.

Sorry!

I am scary!

The lightening was
an unfortunate coincidence.

You look lovely!
Lovely!

I hate this.

I had the most amazing
two weeks planned for us.

And everything I had in mind,
we had to be a lot closer than this.

I've spent the last eight months
in a steel tube with men...

...thinking about this moment.

I am not gonna let a bunch...

...of itchy spots stand between us.

Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

-How's the first day?
-Good. It's like you said.

It's putting numbers
from one column into another.

There you go.

And everybody's nice. I just had
a good talk with that lady Jeannie.

Jeannie? The head of
East Coast operations, Jeannie?

Turns out our kids go
to the same school.

Yeah. Small world, huh?

Weird world.

Your kids?

I figure my character has kids.

There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need explained.

When you're acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

My character,
Joseph the processing guy...

... has two little girls,
Ashley and Brittany.

Ashley copies everything
Brittany does.

Well, invisible kids
can be that way sometimes.

You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

You know what?

Just did.

That's some pretty powerful
imaginary sperm you must have there.

You Know what makes the itching worse?

That you don't stop talking about it?

-Fine.
-Let's just play, okay?

Good, okay.

Here we go, double sixes.

Here we go....

Here we go....

Come to Mama.
Getting ready to roll the dice....

What are you doing?
Are you scratching?

No. This is what I do
for luck, okay?

You're scratching.

Give me the dice.

-Give me the dice.
-No! Here. There!

Look, double sixes!

We can't scratch. We'll scar.

I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

I wanna grab these houses
and rub them all over my body.

-No!
-Give it!

Come on!

You know you want it.
You know you want it too.

Let's just be bad.
It'll feel so good.

Come on.

Oh, God, help me.

-Oh, yeah.
-Okay, good. Now do me.

Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

There you go.

-Don't move.
-Why?

-Don't move.
-What are you...?

Stop that.
Stop that right now.

I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

She make me doing.

-That's a nice color on you.
-You will become pink and blunch baby.

I hope you get a Winnie pork.

You and Milton have to join us
on the boat. Bring the kids.

We'll make a day of it.

That sounds lovely.
We'll have to set it up.

I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.

Thanks.

-Bye-bye, Jeannie.
-Bye-bye, Joseph.

What a phony.

You'll teach her a lesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

-Hey, Mr. Douglas.
-Sir.

Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna
see the report until next Friday?

My group wants to spend
the holiday with family.

I have a family.
I'm gonna be here.

Yeah, Bing.
What's that about?

It's about cutting them
a little slack for morale.

Look, I can get some
rough numbers by Wednesday.

Rough numbers?

This company wasn't built
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

Have the final numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

If you say so, sir.

Joseph's good, isn't he?

I'm going to kill you.

Hey, I just figured Joseph's
the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

You know, get in there,
ruffle some feathers.

Why?

Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

Okay? If you try to pull something...

... he'll call you on it.

"What are you trying to pull?"
he'll say.

Duct tape.

Was I supposed to bring something too?

This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

You're strict.

Well, it's for their own good.

You know, I like the way you have
efficiently folded this tab under.

See, in a tape emergency you could
shave valuable seconds off your time.

Exactly!

God, I love that I can be
totally neurotic around you now.

Tell me the truth.

Don't you like having everything
on your desk perpendicular?

If it's not a right angle,
it is a wrong angle.

-Very good.
-Thank you.

Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.

You're gonna do what to my clocks?

Set them to my time.

I'm confused.

I thought we shared time.

No. See, in my bedroom
I set my clock six minutes fast.

Wanna know why?

Because it's in a slightly different
time zone than the kitchen?

Forget it.

No, come on, tell me.

-You don't understand.
-Come on.

You don't have any obsessive things.

No, that's not true.

Oh, yeah?
Tell me one of yours.

One of my things is
I always separate my sweat socks...

...from my dress socks.

What if they get mixed up?

Boy, I would just....

I would freak out.

You would not.

I can't believe this.
I hate this. You're too normal.

I can't believe you
don't have a "thing."

My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing."

See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off well.

-Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
-Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

He suspects you dropped the ball
on the Lender project.

Why? Why does he suspect that?

At first, he thought it was Joseph...

...but after he asked Joseph about it,
turns out it was you.

-Anyway, I thought you should know.
-All right. That's it.

Look, Joey...

... I realize this is the role
of a lifetime for you...

...and if I could just fire Joseph,
I would. But that's not possible.

So I have to let you both go.

What? Everybody loves Joseph.

I don't. I hate Joseph.

I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.

You can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

All right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

... but I can sleep with his wife.

Not Karen!

Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

You know what?

I just did.

What the hell are you doing?

Oh, it's not me.

It's my character!

Chandie.

The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

...and then laughs about it.

In fact, I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

-Really?
-No, freak show, she's fictional!

Take it easy.

If it means that much to you,
I'll go find something else.

Thank you.

It's just that
I'm gonna miss Joseph.

I liked him. His wife.

She was hot.

And the kids, you gonna put a pour like summer.

Please take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

No, sorry, hon.
Monica's orders.

Well, that wasn't easy.

Okay, dinner's on.

There's a peach cobbler
warming in the oven.

So the plate's gonna be hot, but that
shouldn't be a problem for you.

All right, you kids.
Bye, now.

-Bye.
-Oh, look, look.

A low-budget puppet show.

A shame you can't see
what finger I'm holding up.

-Wine?
-Please.

-Spilled some.
-I got it.

You look beautiful tonight.

What?

Sorry.

You look beautiful.

You know what? That's it.
That's it.

Oh, yes.

Good.

You guys, did you?

Monica...

...wake up.

What's up?

I thought of a thing.

Yeah?

I have to sleep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

No. You have to sleep
on this side of the bed...

... because I have to sleep
on this side of the bed.

Or so I would have you believe.

So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

Hey, come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

All right, go on.

I have to sleep on the west side...

... because I grew up in California...

...and otherwise...

...the ocean would be on the wrong side.

Oh, my God.

You're a freak!

How about that?

Where're you shipping off to?

I really can't say.

Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

I can't say.

Do you get to look through
a periscope thingy?

I'm sorry, but I can't say.

Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

-I better not miss my flight.
-I'll walk you out.

-Bye, Ryan.
-Pleasure. Take care.

So do you think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

You like that, do you?

Oh, yeah.

I'll make some calls.

Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

...Iike having a picnic in Central Park
and coffee at Central Perk.

Oh, I just got that!

Taxi!

Bye, you.

I'm sorry, we're

Hey, sailor.

Is this what you had in mind?

I'll say.

I'm shipping out tomorrow.

Well, then...

...we better make this night count.

Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

Anchors aweigh.

Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.

Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

Honey!

- Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
- Incredible!

I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.

- Who?
- All right. I'll give you one hint.

Warren Beatty.

Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem.

See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.

'Cause he was just so darn cute.

No, as part of the audition.
See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.

Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.

Or you just do it.

I did do it, I'm a professional.

Besides my first girlfriend was Lisa Dibertis,
so I am no stranger to the mustache.

Then what's the problem?

See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says

'good actor, bad kisser'.

Can you believe that, me not a good kisser,

that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.

Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.

The one with Barry And Mindy's Wedding

Hey, what did your agent say?

Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.

Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.

- What, forget it!
- Yeah, right.

Come on, I need your help here.

All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.

You see this, this is a friend.

Uh-huh, let's go.

Oh, wait I have gum.

Okay.

Good, very good, firm but tender.

I'd recommend you to a friend.

Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?

Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men,

maybe you just tensed up a little,

maybe that's what you need to work on.

Yeah, that makes sense.

Over my dead body!

And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!

Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.

Oh my God,

you look so good!

I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people

looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

So don't,
I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.

Because I promised Mindy I would.

Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.

Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor.

And besides you know what I just need

to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?

- I may have.
- Woo-hoo, stuud!

- What's she look like?
- Well, we haven't exactly met,

we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.

Woo-hoo, geeek!

I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl,

you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...

- Get out!
- Nooo!

Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real',

and I did.

Wow! What's that like?

It's like this,

me, no jokes.

All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.

Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way.

- All right, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Richard.

Bye sweetie,

- I love you.
- I love you, too.

I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy,

I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.

What are you talking about? What wedding?

Come on, like you never talk about that.

Nooo! Never!

I mean, we're living in the moment.

God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'

- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing,

give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.

I was laughing at this quip leno made last night.

I was not laughing at your dress,
I love you.

Where's Benny?

There he is!

Where's Benny,

there he is.

Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk,

so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.

Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.

Okay.

Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?

Sure I do.

Yeah, am I in it?

Honey, you are it.

Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.

Keep talkin'.

Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice,

we could move to France,

make French toast.

Okay, so, uh, we're in France,

we're making the toast.

Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

Like a hound?

Not a basset, a bassinet.

You really need the bassinet?

Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.

Oh, hey, I love children,

I have children.

I just don't want to be 70

when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

Look I want you, now.

That's Great.

You know we don't need to talk about this now.

Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future,

I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.

Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.

Joey, no means no!

I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.

Aww, Rach, I think you look cute

And you, uh, you,

- you I could eat with a spoon
- Get away from me I said no!

- Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
- Oh, Richard's here.

I should run down say bye to him

Bye.

So how's your date with your cyberchick going.

Ooh, hey, what is all that?

Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum.

See, she likes art,

and I like funny words.

What does she mean by HH?

It means we're holding hands.

Are you the cutest?

I'm afraid I might just be.

You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person

and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads,

or. It could be a guy.

Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.

It could be like a big giant guy.

Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.

What's going on?

We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live.

Women live longer than men.

How do you not fall down more?

Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'

All right.

"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."

She's married!

Well at least we know she's a woman.

I can't believe she's married.

Aw, man I'm sorry.

This must be very tough for ya, huh.

So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings,

because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.

Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.

- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.

Neither am I.

Hi, there. Are you all right?

Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding,

and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't,

people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.

Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding,

generally people focus on the bride.

God I know, you're right.

All rightie, everybody look at me. Good.

All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.

Okay, I'll see you after the thing.

- Okay, good luck
- Thank you

Okay, Okay.

Why the hell didn't you tell me!

I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do

stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'

Yeah, better than you embarrass and I will go.

Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.

I think the only thing that tops that was, was,

was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.

I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.

Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.

Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.

Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.

Rachel!

Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.

It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear,

in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

You told me you didn't see anything.

I tell ya a lot things!

Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.

Stay well.

Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

Rach! Rach!

- Oh my God, I'm married!
- I know.

I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.

Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.

Min.

Oh Rach, you're still here,

at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.

Yeah, I love that story.

Um, I got a question for you guys.

Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?

Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding,

Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.

Insane!

...from the syphilis.

What?!

Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.

Your choice was that, syphilis?

Hey, sweetie, at least they put you Tutsi show under prospective.

Angela? Joey Tribiani.

Listen, what are ya doing tonight?

I know your seeing that guy, I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....

Hello? Hello?

Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.

- She wants to know what's wrong?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

You're married that's what's wrong.

- Oh, my.
- What?

She wants to meet you in person.

Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too,

okay, but she's married, she has a husband.

What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.

I mean you don't get chances like this all the time,

if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself

when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.

I don't know.

Listen, those bingbongs are the woman who loves you.

Okay, I'll do it!

Oh, yeah! Okay! Great!

Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!

Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.

No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.

No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.

Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.

Okay, last chance.

Again, I'm sorry.

You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.

You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society,

and by that I mean my mom,

has always convinced me that I...

I do,

I have to have children, I'm sorry. I just do.

Yo! Can I have your attention, please,

Best Man, making a toast here.

Thank you.

I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...

What?!

What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.

Thank you, thank you very much.

Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

And Rachel...

- What.
- No, no, no now in all seriousness,

its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight,

and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!

Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...

- Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?

Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

Oh dear God.

Ross,

uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

And, uh, for the record

she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

What are you doing I'm serious.

Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him,

which incidentally worked out pretty well for me

Rachel, took a lot of courage, doesn't has the syphilis and wild with me.

Cheers!

- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach!

And once again she is out of here.

Okay who had 9:45? Um?

Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.

I probably should, but I'm not,

see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.

See now, tonight, all I really wanted was

to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

There's nothing really left to say except....

"Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl.

With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.

She would..."

- Marenge,
- "...marenge, thank you honey,

and do the cha-cha.

And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar.

At the, wait, wait, everybody.."

Okay, I'll do it.

You'll do what?

If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

Oh my God!

If I have to I'll, I'll do all again,

I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing,

I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings,

I'll coach the soccer team.

- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

Monica,

I don't wanna lose you,

so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.

You're the most wonderful man.

And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times,

then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'

But you're not.

Oh my God,

I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

I wanna have a baby,

but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.

God.

I love you.

I know you do.

Me too.

So what now?

I guess we just

keep dancing.

Where is she, Where is she?

Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?

Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.

Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.

Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.

Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot,

you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.

I think what you have to do is try not to...

Oh my God!

OH.....MY.....GAWD!!

OH.....MY.....GOD!!

All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,

because I wanna be a good friend,  and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes.

Wow, you are a good friend,

'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

But that was a hell of a kiss.

Rachel is a very lucky girl.
